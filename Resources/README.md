# Parla-CLARIN / Resources

This directory contains samples of parliamentary debates from various project that serve as
examples of the Parla-CLARIN encoding. All the XML files in this directory should validate against
the current Parla-CLARIN schema, while the subordinate directories contain samples in their source encoding,
hopefully together with script to convert them to the Parla-CLARIN annotation schema.
