# Parla-CLARIN / bin

This directory contains scripts for conversion and validation of the Parla-CLARIN TEI ODD schema and example
documents.

Note that the directory should include the TEI Stylesheets, which are, however .gitgnored.
Before using the conversions, the [Stylesheets](https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets)
should be cloned into the directory `parla-clarin/bin/Stylesheets`.
