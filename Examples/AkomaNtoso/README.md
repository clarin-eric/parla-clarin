# Parla-CLARIN / Resources / AkomaNtoso

This directory contains the 'akn2tei.xsl' XSLT script to convert Akoma
Ntoso documents to Parla-CLARIN and samples of parliamentary debates
in the Akoma Ntoso scheme. The script does not cover the complete AKN
schema, as we could not find documents that express all the possible
elements and attributes, but rather only the cases that have been
encountered in the sample documents. Even here, certain details (such
the conversion of all HTML-like elements) are still on the to do list.
