                                teachers in the country until when some graduate teachers started
                                agitation for recognition and finally broke away and formed the

                                of graduate teachers, BNATcovers nongraduates as well as graduate teachers.</seg>
							              <seg> The professional rights of both members of BNAT and IAGRAT are
                                assured as outlined in the Conditions and Scheme of Service for
                                teachers. In the event, where a member of the Service has a problem,
                                he approaches the association to which he belongs and that
                                association handles the problem with BES in the light of the
