        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>Parliamentary proceedings corpora (PPCs) are a quintessential resource for a wide
        range of research questions from a number of SSH disciplines, such as history and
	sociolinguistics. Their most distinguishing
        characteristic is that they are (typically edited) transcriptions of spoken
        language produced in controlled and regulated circumstances. They are also rich in
        invaluable (sociodemographic) metadata as well as easily available under the Freedom
        of Information Acts set in place to enable informed participation by the public and
        to improve effective functioning of democratic systems, making the datasets even more
        valuable.</p>
        
        <p>Given these reasons and the fact that parliamentary proceedings are often
        available on-line, many researchers have already compiled corpora of parliamentary
        proceedings.  However, these corpora are encoded in a variety of different annotation
        schemes, limiting their interchange and re-use.</p>
        
        <p>In order to overcome this problem, the presented recommendations, called
        Parla-CLARIN, propose a schema that can be used for encoding of parliamentary
        proceedings corpora, primarily for the purposes of scholarly investigations,
        and that could serve as a storage and interchange format for such corpora. These
        recommendations attempt to take into account the following aspects of PPC:
        <list>
          <item>Structure: legislative periods, sessions, topics, speeches, transcription variants</item>
          <item>Metadata: mandates, titles, parliamentary bodies, locations, dates
          and times</item>
          <item>Speakers: sex, date of birth, education, party membership, links to external
          resources</item>
          <item>Political parties: name(s), history, relations</item>
          <item>Speeches: speaker, text, comments, verbal and non-verbal interruptions</item>
          <item>Linguistic annotation: PoS tagging, normalisation, syntax etc.</item>
          <item>Multimedia: audio and video, facsimile of original</item>
        </list>
        </p>
        
        <p>The recommendations are implemented as a parametrisation of the
        <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">TEI
        Guidelines</ref>, which are XML-based recommendations for encoding texts for scholarly
        purposes. As opposed to most other such recommendations, the TEI Guidelines have the
        ambition to be applicable to texts in any natural language, of any date, in any
        literary genre or text type, without restriction on form or content. The TEI
        parametrisation proposed for Parla-CLARIN also allows a wide range of PPC to encoded,
        while making explicit recommendations on the manner of encoding various
        phenomena. The recommendations are written as a TEI ODD document, on the
        basis of which it is possible to derive an XML schema expressed either as a RelaxNG
        schema, a DTD or a W3C schema.</p>

        <p>When using these recommendations, the following points should be taken in consideration:
        <list>

          <item>The TEI Guidelines are a large and complex set of specifications, and the
          Parla-CLARIN recommendations do not attempt to give an introduction to them. Rather,
          it concentrates only on aspects of the Guidelines that are most likely to be of use
          in encoding PPCs.</item>
          
          <item>It is difficult if not impossible to determine in advance what research
          questions a developer of a PPC will want to ask, and so what kind of phenomena they
          will want to encode. While we tried to cater for the more obvious encoding needs, it
          is possible that new users will have to use TEI elements or attributes that are not
          mentioned here.</item>

          <item>Since these recommendations are very much work in progress, we have left the formal
          specification (i.e. the XML schema) rather unconstrained, so it can accommodate
          encoding practices that we have not (yet) foreseen. The downside of this is that the
          XML schemas will allow constructs that are at odds to those that we propose in the
          prose of the recommendations. Therefore, the prose should be taken as the definitive
          way of encoding the phenomena under discussion, i.e. even if a PPC validates against
          the schema, it might still not be encoded according to these recommendations.</item>

          <item>In the text of these recommendations, every mention of an element is linked to
          its definition, where examples of use are also given. The text also makes frequent
          reference to the text of the TEI Guidelines. However, the TEI
          Guidelines give generic examples and explanations, which can be at odds with 
          particular recommendations that are made here, so the ones from the TEI Guidelines
	  should be taken with a grain of salt.</item>

        </list>
        </p>
        
        <p>The rest of these recommendations are structured as follows:

      <div xml:id="sec-scope">
          <head>Scope and purpose</head>
          <p>These recommendations consists of guidelines, a formal TEI schema, and derived
          XML schemas in various schema languages. Theye are intended for the encoding of
          corpora of parliamentary proceedings, regardless of the language or country of
          origin, for the purposes of scholarly investigations, be they from the field of
          linguistics, political science, history or other humanities and social sciences
          disciplines. The recommendations are, in principle, not meant as the primary
          storage format of parliamentary proceedings, such as kept by governmental
          offices, for which <ref target="#sec-akoma">Akoma Ntoso</ref> might be 
          preferred.</p>
          
          <p>In developing a schema for structuring data, two approaches can be adopted: a
          descriptive one, where as much as possible of the original data distinctions are kept
          in the target encoding; or a prescriptive one, where the target encoding is severely
          constrained, to enable seamless data interchange and esp. interoperability with
          software tools. The Parla-CLARIN recommendations adopt the <emph>descriptive</emph>
          approach, as the source data, time and effort devoted to converting it, the intended
          applications, as well as country-specific rules of parliamentary proceedings will
          differ considerably, and it is likely that any prescriptive schema would soon turn
          out to be too restrictive. Nevertheless, the recommendations do try to limit the
          plethora of encoding options otherwise available in TEI to those that could be
          sensibly applied to corpora of parliamentary proceedings, and where more than one
          option is available in TEI to encode a given phenomenon, the schema and especially
          the text guidelines attempt to recommend only one option.</p>

            Language Resources and Technology. Before the beginning of this development CLARIN
            had already organised a number of initiatives and events that deal with
            parliamentary corpora:
            <list>
              <item>CLARIN Traveling Campus <q>Talk of Europe</q>, where three <q>Creative
              Camps</q> were organised in 2014 and 2015 and which used the proceedings of
              the European Parliament, curated as
              <ref target="https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-x62-ew3m">linked open data</ref></item>
              <item>CLARIN-PLUS cross-disciplinary workshop

            </list>
            At these events it became clear that existing parliamentary corpora are
            encoded in many different ways, presenting a barrier to their
            interchange. Therefore the CLARIN Interoperability Committee organised a
            focused
            <q><ref target="https://www.clarin.eu/blog/clarin-parlaformat-workshop">CLARIN
            ParlaFormat</ref></q> workshop (May 23-24, 2019, Amersfoort) with selected
            participants at which the idea of the Parla-CLARIN recommendations were introduced,
            the participants presented their own experiences with encoding parliamentary
            corpora and gave their comments to the draft proposal.

            <head>Akoma Ntoso</head>
            <p>While there are a large number of recommendations and standards that could in
            principle be used to encode parliamentary proceedings, the <ref
            target="http://www.akomantoso.org/">Akoma Ntoso</ref> standard stands out in that
            it was explicitly developed as an XML format for encoding legislative and judiciary
            documents including parliamentary proceedings. Akoma Ntoso is an OASIS standard and
            has already been used to encode various legal documents in a number of
            countries. It defines an <ref
            target="http://docs.oasis-open.org/legaldocml/akn-core/v1.0/os/part1-vocabulary/akn-core-v1.0-os-part1-vocabulary.html">XML
            schema</ref> for modelling for legal documents (called AKN), uses <ref
            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records">FRBR
            concepts</ref> and has a built-in relation to ontologies.</p>

            <p>It is thus a reasonable question why CLARIN does not simply adopt AKN, rather
            than developing a conceptually very different parametrisation of TEI. The main
            reasons for this are the following:
            <list>
              <item>Unfamiliarity of corpus compilers and users with AKN, and relatively
              good familiarity with TEI: for example, of the 16 talks presenting PPCs at the <ref
              target="https://www.clarin.eu/event/2019/parlaformat-workshop">CLARIN ParlaFormat
              workshop</ref>, 10 used a TEI encoding, or an encoding <q>inspired by TEI</q>. It
              should also be noted that for most corpus compiler PPCs will be only one type of
              the corpora they will be compiling, so it is somewhat unrealistic for them to learn
              AKN and develop conversion scripts from it for just one type of corpus; on the
              other hand, TEI can be used for practically any type of corpora.</item>
              <item>AKN makes no provisions for storing speaker meta-data, which is rather
              accessed from external data sources and using a specialised referencing system; on
              the other hand, TEI has a number of elements for recording details about
              persons. For reasons of completeness, uniform and easier processing, and
              experimental replicability it is better to include these data directly in the
              corpus.</item>
              <item>AKN has no built-in support for linguistic annotation (apart from named
              entities). And while it would be possible to add elements for such annotation via
              a different namespace to AKN, AKN has no provisions for extending its schema,
              while TEI already has such elements available. As the main purpose of this
              proposal is to cater for linguistic analyses of parliamentary proceedings, TEI
              seems a better choice.</item>
            </list>
            Nevertheless, AKN is an important schema for modelling parliamentary proceedings,
            and some solutions of AKN were used in developing the Parla-CLARIN proposal, in
            particular the typology of divisions of a document. Also developed was a (partial)
            conversion for AKN to Parla-CLARIN, which covers some example documents, further
            discussed in the Section on the <ref target="#sec-convakn">Conversion from Akoma
            Ntoso</ref>.</p>
          </div>

        <div xml:id="sec-rdf">
          <head>RDF</head>
          <p>The Resource Description Framework (<ref
          target="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</ref>) is a W3C specification and a standard model
          for computer-processable data interchange on the Web. It is also the base format for
          modelling information in the context of Linked Open Data (<ref
          target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">LOD</ref>), an influential model
          for linking data on the Web. And while LOD data is typically not concerned with
          language data, there is also the <q>Linguistic Linked Open Data Cloud</q> (<ref
          target="http://linguistic-lod.org/llod-cloud">LLOD</ref>) initiative which is
          explicitly targeted towards language resources. RDF/LOD has also been quite popular
          for modelling parliamentary debates (e.g. the already mentioned <ref
          target="https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-x62-ew3m">Talk of Europe</ref> LOD dataset),
          so, again, the question arises why not use RDF to encode such data, rather than
          developing a TEI-based solution.</p>

          <p>In this case the answer is, at least partially, to do with the community addressed
          by the Parla-CLARIN recommendations and the preferences of this community: while LOD
          is targeted to computer scientists and the concept of a machine-processable and
          linked Word-Wide Web, TEI much more addresses researchers from (digital) humanities
          and of internally complete resources. In practical terms this is seen in the
          difference between RDF encoded data, which is machine processable but hardly human
          readable or editable and highly connected to external data sources, while TEI
          documents are relatively self-explanatory, esp. after some exposure to the TEI
          Guidelines, can be edited in any XML editor and mostly self-contained. And while
          there exists the LLOD initiative that addresses linguistic annotation, the initiative
          seems to have lost momentum, and also has other concerns to addressing detailed
          encoding of a particular type of language resources - in fact, the same can be said
          for most RDF attempts at encoding parliamentary data, which encode only rather
          shallow aspects of such data.</p>

          <p>But while this specification does not see RDF data as the ideal framework to
          encode parliamentary proceedings corpora for storage and interchange, it does take RDF
          as a useful down-stream model for exploiting such corpora, i.e. developing a TEI to
          RDF conversion is a concern, which it taken further in the Section on the <ref
          target="#sec-conrdf">Conversion to RDF</ref>.</p>

      <head>General requirements</head>
      
      <p>A Parla-CLARIN corpus should, in general, capture as much of the text and markup
      from the source as possible, while the presence of graphical items or other elements
      that could not or were not transcribed should be indicated by markup, in particular
      with the use of <gi>gap</gi>.</p>
      
      <div xml:id="sec-chars">
          <head>Characters</head>
          
          <p>The corpus should be encoded in Unicode, using the UTF-8 character encoding, at
          least for European languages.  In cases where the original contains characters from
          the Unicode Private Use Area, these should be either given their closest
          equivalents.<note>TEI also allows for preserving the original codepoint even for PUA
          by using the <gi>g</gi> element, the use of which is further explained in the Section
          on <ref

          Glyphs, and Writing Modes</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. However, such characters will
          rarely if ever be used in PPCs, so the current Parla-CLARIN proposal does not include
          the gaiji module which allows these elements - if they are needed, then the
          Parla-CLARIN ODD needs to be changed.</note></p>
          
          <p>End-of-line hyphens can be removed, and the split words joined in order to
          simplify linguistic processing. It is recommended that this practice is documented
          in the TEI header of the corpus, in the <gi>hyphenation</gi> element.</p>
          
          <p>Two characters, esp. prevalent when the source documents are in Word, deserve
          special mention:
          
          <list>
            <item>No-Break Space (U+00A0) prevents, with some applications, collapsing
            consecutive white space characters into a single space. As Parla-CLARIN is not
            interested in preserving the details of the layout, it is recommended that this
            character is substituted by the normal space (U+0020). The same holds for other
            variants of spaces (U+2000 - U+200A), which are, however, used much less
            frequently.</item>
            
            <item>Soft Hyphen (U+00AD) indicates that a word can be hyphenated at that
            point. This character should be removed from the corpus, as they only complicate
            further processing.</item>
          </list>
          </p>
          
          <p>While not required, it is sensible to also normalise sequences of whitespace
          characters (such as tabulators, end-of-line characters and spaces) into a single
          space or end-of-line character. Again, this simplifies further (esp. linguistic)
          processing.</p>

          <p>Difficult encoding situations that are not covered by the TEI Guidelines
          should be documented in the <gi>editorialDecl</gi> of the corpus TEI header.  In
          particular, if the source texts has been changed (so, omitting or normalising
          figures, text, EOL hyphens, quotes, special characters, etc. as discussed above)
          this practice should be documented in the <gi>correction</gi>,
          <gi>normalization</gi>, <gi>quotation</gi>, and, as mentioned, in the
          <gi>hyphenation</gi> element of the editorial declaration. Two further elements,
          namely <gi>segmentation</gi> and <gi>interpretation</gi> can also be used to
          document these aspects of the encoding process. The example below illustrates
          the use of these elements:

                <p>The texts are segmented into utterances, segments (corresponding to

          <head>Languages</head>
          <p>The language of an element's text content is in TEI, as in XML, signaled by the
          value of its <att>xml:lang</att> attribute.  The Parla-CLARIN recommendations require
          that each element that contains text is either marked by this attribute, or one of
          its ancestors is; in particular, the root element of the corpus should have an
          <att>xml:lang</att> attribute. For multilingual documents (excluding cases where only
          a minor part of the text is in another language), the language code if the root
          element should be <q>mul</q> for <q>multiple languages</q>. Note that if, going by
          the ancestor axis, the values of two <att>xml:lang</att> are in conflict, the one
          closer to the context node is relevant one.
          </p>
          
          <p>The values of <att>xml:lang</att> should follow <ref
          target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP 47</ref>, cf. also <q><ref
          target="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-when-xmllang">xml:lang in XML
          document schemas</ref></q>.</p>
          
          <p>It is good practice to document the languages used in the <gi>langUsage</gi>
          element of the TEI header.</p>
          
          <p>Apart from the above considerations, a related question is where to draw the line
          between the object and meta languages, i.e. the language of the corpus and the
          language of the mark-up. The TEI defines the names of the elements and attributes in
          English, and the language of the corpus will, of course, depend on the country of the
          parliament. It is less straightforward to decide in which language the attribute
          values (such as the values of the <att>type</att> attribute) should be. Parla-CLARIN
          recommends that these should also be in English.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-idents">
          <head>Identifiers and referencing</head>
          <p>In order to simply refer to elements of a TEI document (i.e. a Parla-CLARIN
          corpus), elements can be marked with an ID, i.e. given the <att>xml:id</att> attribute
          with a unique value, obeying certain format requirements as defined by
          <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-id/">W3C</ref>.</p>
          
          <p>Parla-CLARIN requires an <att>xml:id</att> attribute on the root element of
          each corpus file, which should, furthermore, be identical to the filename (modulo
          the file extension).  Parla-CLARIN also recommends that the divisions of the
          document (element <gi>div</gi>) should also be given identifiers. While any
          element can be given an <att>xml:id</att>, this is in general, not a good idea;
          rather, only those elements that will or could be referenced should be marked with
          this attribute.</p>
          
          <p>TEI offers a number of attributes that contain (URI) pointers.  Where the reference
          is to an element inside the document, the value of the <att>xml:id</att> being
          referred to should be preceded by a hash (#), as mandated by the XML standard. If the
          ID pointed to is from another document, them the full URI needs to be used.  However,
          as such URIs can be very long, TEI also offers another way of pointing, which can be
          used to shorten such long URIs, and this is defined by the <gi>prefixDef</gi> element
          in the TEI header. So, for example, if the definitions of MULTEXT-East feature
          structures are stored in the XML document
          <val>http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/tables/msd-fslib-sl.xml</val>, while the corpus uses
          pointers to these definitions
          (e.g. <val>http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/tables/msd-fslib-sl.xml#Pd-nsg</val>), then,
          with the appropriate definition of the prefix, we can use in the corpus much sorter
          pointers such as <val>mte:Pd-nsg</val>, which are then, via a regular expression
          mapping in the prefix definition converted to the full URI.
          </p>

        <div xml:id="sec-temporal">
          <head>Temporal information</head>
          <p>Parliamentary corpora can contain significant time-related information, e.g. the
          date and time of a sitting, the start and end of an MP's affiliation to a particular
          party, the dates of the beginning and end of a political party etc. In general, such
          information in TEI is stored in the attributes of the pertinent element, which take
          as their values a date and possibly time, according to the ISO 8601 Date and Time
          Formats, and specified in the <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/">XML
          Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition</ref>. TEI offers a very rich set of
          attributes and ancillary elements to specify time-related information, which are
          discussed in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#CONADA">Dates
          and Times</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>

          <p>Parla-CLARIN users are free to use any of the TEI temporal attributes and
          elements, however, for most purposes, the following five attributes will suffice:
          <list>
            <item><att>when</att>: when a certain event happened;</item>
            <item><att>from</att>, <att>to</att>: the start and end of an event or state;</item>
            <item><att>notBefore</att>, <att>notAfter</att>: the earliest and latest known
            time that where an event or state took place, used in cases where the exact time
            is not known.</item>
          </list>

        </div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-files">
          <head>Files</head>
          <p>While this recommendations make the assumption that a complete PPC is one TEI XML
          document, this does not mean that it also has to be stored in one file, as the file
          structure is distinct from the concept of XML documents. To enable one XML document
          to be composed of many files, the <ref
          target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">XInclude</ref> mechanism should be
          used. Typically, a corpus will then be composed of a file containing the root XML
          element and the corpus header, while individual text files will be included in the
          corpus using the <gi>include</gi> element from the XInclude namespace, as illustrated
          by the following example:

          <eg xml:id="exa-xinclude">
            <![CDATA[<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="Sk-11/SI-1990-05-07-01.xml"/>]]>
          </eg>
          </p>
          
          <p>As mentioned, we recommend that the file has the same name as the value of the
          <att>xml:id</att> attribute of the root element of the file. This e.g. guarantees
          that each file of the corpus has a unique name.</p>

          <!-- Komentar, da <teiCorpus> ni nujen -->
          
          <p>As illustrated below, a CLARIN-Parla corpus is typically rooted in a
          <gi>teiCorpus</gi> element. The <gi>teiHeader</gi> of the corpus then contains the
          metadata for the complete corpus, including the metadata that is marked with
          the <att>xml:id</att> attribute and referred to by the subordinate <gi>TEI</gi> elements,
	  such as the defined taxonomies and the list of speakers.</p>
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-docstructure">

              <!-- More TEI elements here -->
            </teiCorpus>
          </egXML>

          <p>We do not specify what an individual <gi>TEI</gi> element should contain, as
          the size and granularity of parliamentary proceedings corpora, not to mention the
          national rules of structuring the workings of the parliament, will differ
          substantially. Typically, however, and individual <gi>TEI</gi> element would
          contain one sitting or session or one day, in any case such data that has common
          metadata that distinguishes it from the other <gi>TEI</gi> elements in the
          corpus.</p>

          <p>In cases of smaller corpora, the top level <gi>teiCorpus</gi> can also be omitted,
          so the complete corpus is rooted simply in a <gi>TEI</gi> element.</p>
          
          <p>As illustrated below, the <gi>text</gi> element can, apart from the obligatory
          <gi>body</gi>, also contain front matter in <gi>front</gi> and back matter in
          <gi>back</gi>. While the <gi>body</gi> will contain the transcription proper
          (i.e. the speeches), the former contains preamble text, and the latter various
          appendices or texts that are related to the speeches.</p>

          <p>In the text <gi>body</gi>, as well as in the <gi>front</gi> and <gi>back</gi>
          matter, the element that further organises the content into sections is the division,
          <gi>div</gi>, and each of the three <gi>text</gi> elements (if present) should
          contain at least one division.</p>

          <p>The divisions can be nested, as shown in the example below:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-divsimple">

                  <head>Representation of members of the Federal Government</head>
                  ...
                </div>
                <div>
                  <head>Hour of topical interest</head>
                  ...
                </div>
                <div>
                  <head>Announcement of an urgent request</head>
                  ...
                </div>
              </div>
            </body>
          </egXML>
          In general it is a complicated question what should constitute a division of a
          transcription, with the pragmatic solution being that a division will be whatever has
          a heading (than can be recognised by the up-conversion software) in the source
          transcription.</p>

          <p>The divisions can be further characterised by their <att>type</att> and, possibly,
          <att>subtype</att> attributes. The use of these attributes makes sense in cases where
          the source either explicitly (e.g. via its structure, as in Akoma Ntoso) or
          implicitly (e.g. via pattern matching the content of the headings) indicates what
          kind of a division it is. For example:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-divtype">
            <body>
              <div>
                ...
                <div type="representation">
                  <head>Representation of members of the Federal Government</head>
                  ...
                </div>
                <div type="topical">
                  <head>Hour of topical interest</head>
                  ...
                </div>
                <div type="request">
                  <head>Announcement of an urgent request</head>
                  ...
                </div>
              </div>
            </body>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>If used, the values of the <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> attributes will
          depend on the parliamentary rules of the particular country, on the need to
          distinguish the types of divisions, as well as on the ability to automatically
          recognise them or the available effort to manually add them. The Parla-CLARIN
          specification does therefore not enforce the use of these attributes nor does it
          restrict their values.  However, the definition of <gi>div</gi> does give a set of
          sample values for <att>type</att>, which correspond to the names of the structure
          elements defined by <ref target="#sec-akoma">Akoma Ntoso</ref>. Below we give an
          example of a relatively complex structure made on the basis of an Akoma
          Ntoso document, where the <att>subtype</att> attribute encodes the values of the
          corresponding <att>name</att> attribute of AKN:

          <head>Document variants</head>
          <p>Parliamentary proceedings often exist in two versions, the original,
          <q>raw</q> transcription, and the edited, <q>redacted</q> transcription, which
          is then published. If both versions can be available, it is interesting for some
          research questions to also have both versions transcriptions available for study
          in the scope of a PPC.</p>

          <p>TEI offers a number of options on how to encode variant texts, most of them
          discussed in the <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.htm">Chapter on
          Linking, Segmentation, and Alignment</ref>. We here present the simplest option,
          where it is assumed that each transcription exists in a separate TEI document
          and that the segments that should be aligned between the raw and redacted
          transcriptions are explicitly marked up in the text. As shown in the example
          below, which gives one segment from the file <code>trans-raw.xml</code>
          and one from the file <code>trans-red.xml</code> it is in this case
          enough to specify the <att>xml:id</att> on both elements and use the
          <att>corresp</att> attribute to point to the aligned segment:

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-variants">
            <!-- From trans-raw.xml: -->
            <seg xml:id="raw.1" corresp="trans-red.xml#red.1">What did, uh, who say that?</seg>

            <!-- From trans-red.xml: -->
            <seg xml:id="red.1" corresp="trans-raw.xml#raw.1">Who said that?</seg>
          </egXML>
          It should be noted that the relation between the aligned elements does not need
          to be 1-1: if the relation is 0-1 or 1-0, then the non-aligned element is simply
          not given in a <att>corresp</att>; if the relation is n-1 or 1-n, then several
          IDs are given as values of the <att>corresp</att> attribute,
          e.g. <code>corresp="trans-raw.xml#raw.3 trans-raw.xml#raw.4"</code>.</p>
        </div>
        
      </div>

      <div xml:id="sec-metadata">
        <head>Corpus metadata</head>
        <p>TEI allows significant metadata to be added to a document.  The metadata is
        contained in the <gi>teiHeader</gi> element, which in corpora can appear at two
        levels:
        <list>
          <item>the overall corpus teiHeader;</item>
          <item>the teiHeader of the individual corpus texts, i.e. the <gi>TEI</gi> element.</item>
        </list>
        It is recommended that the metadata that is common to the whole corpus is stored in
        the corpus TEI header, whereas the text-specific metadata is in the corpus text TEI
        header.</p>
        
        <p>It is outside the scope of this specification to give all the details of a
        <gi>teiHeader</gi> element, for this, the user is referred to the Section on the <ref
        target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html">TEI header</ref>
        of the TEI Guidelines, and, of course, to the example corpora that are part of the
        Parla-CLARIN Git repository. Here we do, however, give some examples and concentrate on
        the metadata that is esp. relevant to parliamentary proceedings corpora.</p>

        <div xml:id="sec-speakers">
          <head>Speaker metadata</head>
          <p>Unlike some other proposals, in particular Akoma Ntoso, the Parla-CLARIN recommendations
          assume that speaker meta-data is also included in the corpus,<note>Of course, this
          does not meant that links with corpus-external URIs are not allowed.</note> as
          this allows the corpus to be stand-alone with all the relevant data necessary for
          analysis already included in it.</p>
          
          <p>Information on speakers is given in the corpus TEI header, in particular in the
          <gi>listPerson</gi> element, itself a part of the participant description,
          i.e. the <gi>particDesc</gi> element.</p>

          <p>A <gi>listPerson</gi> typically contains <gi>person</gi> elements, which give
          information on an individual person, as the example below illustrates.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-speakers">
            <person xml:id="KucanMilan1941">
              <persName>
                <surname>Kučan</surname>
                <forename>Milan</forename>
              </persName>
              <sex value="M">male</sex>
              <birth when="1941-01-14">
                <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3197229">Križevci</placeName>
              </birth>
            </person>
          </egXML>

          Each <gi>person</gi> must have an <att>xml:id</att> attribute, so that it can be
          referred to from the transcription. Apart from that, the only required element is
          <gi>persName</gi>, giving the name of the person, which can then be decomposed into
          the person surname(s) and forename(s) as well as giving more details on the
          decomposition of their name, as explained in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPER">Personal
          Names</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>

          <p>As illustrated, further person metadata can contain the sex of the person and
          their birth date and place. Further elements are the persons <gi>death</gi> date and
          place, as well as (time stamped) <gi>education</gi>, <gi>occupation</gi>, and
          <gi>affiliation</gi>.</p>

          <p>In the context of PPCs, the <gi>affiliation</gi> is especially important, as it
          denotes the person's party membership. As this is not necessarily fixed, a
          <gi>person</gi> can contain several <gi>affiliation</gi> elements, each one with its
          temporal duration.  Furthermore, the affiliation should not contain (only) directly
          the name of the party, but rather the link to the party's definition, as explained in
          Section on <ref target="#sec-party">Party metadata</ref>. The example below
          illustrates this encoding.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-affiliation">
            <person xml:id="JanezPodobnik1960">
              <persName>
                <surname>Janez</surname>
                <forename>Podobnik</forename>
              </persName>
              <affiliation ref="#party.SDZ" from="1990-05-16" to="1991-05-08"/>
              <affiliation ref="#party.FLM" from="1991-05-09" to="1993-05"/>
              <affiliation ref="#party.ZZZ" from="1993-06-16"/>
            </person>
          </egXML>
          </p>

          <p>Persons can have further attributes, and TEI offers various elements (typically
          typed) to express them; they are introduced in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPERSEpc">Personal
          Characteristics</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. The two more general ones are
          <gi>state</gi>, which contains the description of some status or quality attributed
          to a person,(or organization) often at some specific time or for a specific date
          range and <gi>trait</gi>, which differs from <gi>state</gi> that it is independent of
          the volition or action of the holder and usually not at some specific time or for a
          specific date range. The former could, for example, be used to encode the fact that a
          PM was jailed for a given period of time, while the latter would e.g. be used for the
          fact that a PM is handicapped.</p>

          <p>It is often advantageous to refer to external knowledge sources about a person,
          such as Wikipedia or VIAF. This is encoded using the <gi>idno</gi> element, whose
          content is typically an URI, while the <att>type</att> attribute denotes the kind
          of knowledge source referred to.

          <p>Information on political parties, as well as other groupings of people, such as
          ministries, is contained in the <gi>listOrg</gi> element, which is, just as
          <gi>listPerson</gi> element, contained in the <gi>particDesc</gi> element of the
          corpus TEI header. The Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#ND-org">Organizational
          Data</ref> of the TEI Guidelines gives the particulars on how to encode data on
          organisations. An example of two <gi>org</gi> elements with a complex name
          structure and interdependencies is given below:
          
          <!-- Note that @full="init" is misused, at least according to the TEI definition -->
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-parties">
            <org xml:id="pp.SDZ" role="political_party" xml:lang="sl">

            </org>
            <org xml:id="pp.DS" role="political_party">
              <orgName full="yes" from="1989-02-16" to="2003-09">Socialdemokratska stranka Slovenije</orgName>
              <orgName full="yes"  xml:lang="en" from="1989-02-16" to="2003-09">Social Democratic Party of Slovenia</orgName>

              <orgName full="yes"  xml:lang="en" from="2003-09">Slovenian Democratic Party</orgName>

            </org>
          </egXML>
          
          As with persons, each organisation must contain an <att>xml:id</att> attribute, so
          that <gi>person</gi> elements can refer to it. The fact that the organisation is a
          political party is encoded in the <att>role</att> attribute, where the suggested
          values are defined in the Parla-CLARIN schema. The name(s) of the party are given in
          the <gi>orgName</gi> element, which also uses the <att>full</att> attribute to
          distinguish between the full name of the part and the initials of the party. Parties
          are also created and dissolved, and can also change their name.  The former is
          indicated by the <gi>event</gi> element, which, in the example above, we have typed
          as "existence" and where the dates of its existence are given in the <att>from</att>
          and <att>to</att> attributes. The same attributes on the <gi>orgName</gi> elements
          indicate the temporal duration of the parties names.<note>Note that there can exist a
          date where both names are valid names of the party - it is up to the processing
          software to make sense of this situation.</note></p>
        </div>

        <div xml:id="sec-relation">
          <head>Relationships between people and parties</head>
          
          <p>It is also possible to encode relations between people and parties, e.g. kinship
          between PMs, or the fact that one party is the successor of another one. For this
          purpose, TEI defines the <gi>listRelation</gi> element explained in detail in the
          Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPERSREL">Personal
          Relationships</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. This element can be contained either by
          the <gi>listPerson</gi> or <gi>listOrg</gi> elements and, in turn, contains the
          <gi>relation</gi> element that defines one relation. The example below shows a
          relation between people.

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatpers">
            <relation name="parents" passive="#sbi243926" active="#sbi243926-0 #sbi243926-1"/>
          </egXML>

          The relation defines the relationship "parents" between the <att>active</att>
          persons of this relationship (i.e. those defined in the <gi>person</gi> element
          with the <att>xml:id</att> values of <val>sbi243926-0</val> and
          <val>sbi243926-1</val>) and the <att>passive</att> person of this relationship
          (i.e. the <gi>person</gi> element with the <att>xml:id</att> value of
          <val>sbi243926</val>).</p>

          <p>Relationships can also be mutual, e.g. in the case of spouses, as illustrated below
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatmutual">
            <relation name="spouse" mutual="#sbi243926 #sbi243929"/>
          </egXML>
          </p>

          <p>Relationship can also exist between parties (i.e. organisations), for example the
          fact that one party is a successor of another. This can be expressed as in the
          example below.

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-succparty">
            <relation name="successor" passive="#pp.SDZ" active="#pp.DS"/>
          </egXML>

          Another example is of a coalition of parties, where the coalition is also encoded
          as an organisation, while the <gi>relation</gi> gives the membership of the
          individual parties in the coalition.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatorg">
            <listOrg>
              <org xml:id="cl.DEMOS" role="coalition">
                <orgName full="init">DEMOS</orgName>
              </org>
              <listRelation>
                <relation type="members"
                          pasive="#cl.DEMOS"
                          active="#pp.SDZ #pp.SDSS #pp.SKD #pp.SKZ #pp.SOS #pp.ZS"/>
              </listRelation>
            </listOrg>
          </egXML>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div xml:id="sec-transcript">
        <head>Transcriptions</head>
        
        <p>The transcriptions of the parliamentary debates the central part of these
        recommendations and this section explains how to encode the transcriptions of speeches
        proper, the commentary inserted by the transcribers, and the encoding of interruption
        of speeches and various verbal and non-verbal incidents in the parliament. Most of
        these elements are explained in the Chapter on <ref
        target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TS.html">Transcription of
        Speech</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-uterrance">
          <head>Utterances and commentary</head>
          <p>In the transcriptions the main distinction to be made is between the
          transcriptions of the utterances of the speakers against the commentary inserted by
          the transcriber, such as the titles of the divisions, results of voting, comments on
          what is happening in the chamber etc. The former should be encoded using the
          utterance element, <gi>u</gi>, while latter are encoded using a variety of elements,
          such as <gi>head</gi> or <gi>note</gi>, and possibly others, as further discussed
          below. Below we give an example of a rather straightforward start of a division:
        
          <!-- Do we / will we have a typology of notes as well? -->
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relations">

          The example starts with the division heading, saying that this is the National Assembly
          of the Republic of Slovenia, with the second heading specifying that this is the
          continuation of the 39th session. Next come three notes, first one specifying who
          chaired the session, the second when the session started and the third the name of the
          first speaker. It should be noted that these are not formal specifications, rather,
          they are simply parts of the transcript that have been wrapped in certain elements.</p>
          
          <p>After these preliminary notes comes the transcript of the speech proper, which, as
          mentioned, is encoded using the <gi>u</gi> element. Its main attribute is
          <att>who</att>, giving the pointer to the <gi>person</gi> element containing the
          metadata of the speaker. The <gi>u</gi> element can also have the <att>ana</att>
          attribute giving one or more pointers to a typology of types of speakers. In our case,
          it would point to a category that specifies that the speaker is the chair of the
          session.</p>
          
          <p>The utterances can (but are not required to) be segmented using the generic
          TEI element for segments, <gi>seg</gi>, encoding the paragraphs of the source
          transcription.<note>The reason why the TEI element for paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) is not
          used is that utterances, being essentially (transcriptions of) spoken text, do not
          allow for internal paragraphs, a concept pertinent to written text.</note></p>
        </div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-interruptions">
          <head>Interrupted utterances</head>
          <p>A special case occurs when a transcription note states that somebody interrupted
          the speaker and gives the transcript of the interruption, with the main speaker
          then continuing with their speech, as in this snippet of a made-up transcript:
          
          <eg>Boris Johnson: I propose a no-deal Brexit. /Jeremy Corbyn: Traitor!/ Because 
          England does not want any dealings with the European Union.</eg>
          
          While the interruption might be encoded as a <gi>note</gi>, it is more precisely
          encoded as a separate utterance, which brings with it the problem that nested
          utterances are not allowed, so the main utterance needs to be split into two (or
          more) pieces. The example below illustrates how this is encoded:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-splitu">
            <u who="#BorisJohnson" xml:id="GB001.8.3" next="#GB001.8.5">I propose a no-deal Brexit.</u>
            <u who="#JeremyCorbyn" xml:id="GB001.8.4">Traitor!</u>
            <u who="#BorisJohnson" xml:id="GB001.8.5" prev="#GB001.8.3">Because England does not want any dealings with the European Union.</u>
          </egXML>
          
          As can be seen, the split is indicated by the use of the <att>next</att> attribute on
          the first part of the split utterance, and, if so desired, by the <att>prev</att>
          attribute of the next part of the split utterance. The values of the attributes are
          pointers to the next of previous part of the split utterance.<note>Note that, in
          general, the utterance can also be split in the middle of a sentence, which brings
          with it problems for automatic linguistic processing, as, ideally, the parts should
          be first joined, and only then processed.</note></p>

        <div xml:id="sec-incidents">
          <head>Incidents</head>
          <p>In general, transcriber comments are encoded using <gi>note</gi> but some such
          comments can be encoded using more precise TEI elements.<note>Whether these specific
          elements will be used or simply encoded using notes, and, indeed, whether such notes
          are preserved in the Parla-CLARIN encoding at all, will depend on the needs and
          resources of each particular project.</note> In particular, the TEI module for
          Transcription of Speech (<q><ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TS.html#TSBA">Elements
          unique to spoken texts</ref></q>) defines the following elements that can correspond
          to various types of transcriber's comments:
          <list>
            <item><gi>vocal</gi> marks any vocalized but not necessarily lexical phenomenon,
            e.g. laughter, sounds of (dis)agreement from the benches etc.</item>
            <item><gi>kinesic</gi> marks any communicative phenomenon, not necessarily
            vocalized, for example a gesture, frown, etc.</item>
            <item><gi>incident</gi> marks any phenomenon or occurrence, not necessarily
            vocalized or communicative, for example incidental noises or other events
            affecting communication.</item>
          </list>
          
          The artificial example below illustrates the use of these three elements:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-incidents">
            <u xml:lang="sl" who="#SDZ5.AhačičMonika">Spoštovani kolegice poslanke!</u>
            <vocal who="#opposition"><desc xml:lang="en">shouting</desc></vocal>
            <kinesic who="#SDZ5.AhačičMonika"><desc xml:lang="en">banging of the gavel</desc></kinesic>
            <incident><desc xml:lang="en">Army storms the parliament</desc></incident>
          </egXML>
          It should be noted that the three <q>incident</q> elements could have been also
          encoded within the <gi>u</gi> element, however, it is recommended to have them placed
          outside, because, ideally, the utterance elements should contain pure text only, as
          this significantly simplifies their linguistic processing.</p>

        <div xml:id="sec-voting">
          <head>Voting results</head>
          <p>One further aspects of the transcripts, which can be of particular interest for
          some researchers, needs to be mentioned, namely voting results. Voting results are
          typically mentioned in the transcripts as a note, and we follow Akoma Ntoso in its
          treatment. Assuming a <gi>taxonomy</gi> in the TEI header that defines "ayes" and
          "noes", the note can be marked up using the <gi>measure</gi> element, as the
          following example shows:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-voting1">
            <note type="summary">(Question carried by
            <measure xml:id="quantity_1" corresp="#ayes" quantity="72">72</measure> to
            <measure xml:id="quantity_2" corresp="#noes" quantity="56">56</measure>
            votes)</note>
          </egXML>
          </p>

          <p>In addition to marking up the voting results in-line, they can also be more
          formally encoding at the start of the <gi>body</gi>, using the <gi>listEvent</gi>
          element to contain the list of individual votes in the <gi>event</gi> elements. Below
          we give a more complicated example, where the voting was followed by a recount, and
          this fact is encoded in the <gi>relation</gi> element, of course, again assuming the
          appropriate taxonomies in the teiHeader:

        <head>Linguistic annotation</head>
        <p>To be more useful, text corpora are typically linguistically annotated and this
        section introduces some basic types of linguistic annotation that can be added to
        PPCs; these examples should be sufficient for users to be able to add further types of
        linguistic annotation to PPC corpora.</p>
        <p>It is recommended that linguistically
        annotated PPCs are stored in two versions, one with the linguistic annotations, and
        the other without them. The reason for this is that many users prefer to use the
        plain-text version, e.g. as they want to perform their own linguistic annotation, or
        this kind of annotation is simply not relevant for their research questions.</p>
        
        <p>The TEI Guidelines discuss basic linguistic annotation in their Chapter on <ref
        target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html">Simple Analytic
        Mechanisms</ref> and we follow one particular option given there. In particular, it is
	recommended that (where possible) the
        annotation is in-line (as opposed to stand-off), i.e. that the linguistic annotation is
        given in the main document, and therefore mixed with the other annotations, rather than
        in a separate document with pointers into the base text.</p>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-anawords">
          <head>Word-level annotation</head>
          
          <p>Basic linguistic annotation comprises tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging and
          lemmatisation, and (from a processing point of view) also sentence segmentation. The Parla-CLARIN
          recommendations specialise the principles given in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html#AILALW">Lightweight
          Linguistic Annotation</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. The following example shows the
          basic principles of the annotation:

            </s>
          </egXML>
          
          Sentences are marked up using the <gi>s</gi> element, words with the <gi>w</gi>
          element and punctuation symbols with the <gi>pc</gi> element. To retain the linguistically
          significant whitespace, the <att>join</att> element is used, with the main relevant
          values being <val>no</val> (assumed to be the default), <val>right</val> (no
          whitespace to the right of the token) and <val>left</val> (no whitespace to the left
          of the token). While, in the preceding example, it would be more intuitive to have the
          value <val>left</val> marked on the full-stop, we recommend that <val>right</val> is
          used on the preceding token, as this simplifies processing.</p>
          
          <p>The base form of words is given in the <att>lemma</att> attribute,<note>Note
          that punctuation characters, <gi>pc</gi>, do not have a <att>lemma</att> attribute,
          as they cannot sensibly be said to have lemmas.</note> while situation with the
          part-of-speech tags is somewhat more complicated. For analytic tagsets, where a
          "part-of-speech tag" is actually a set of attribute-values, as in the example
          above, the <att>msd</att> attribute should be used. For synthetic tagsets, such as
          the <ref
          target="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html">Penn
          Treebank tagset</ref>, which have atomic tags that cannot always be decomposed into
          attribute-value pairs (e.g. "TO" for the word "to"), a better alternative is the
          <att>pos</att> attribute. There is also the third option, for tags that are
          strings, however, they are just a shorthand for a feature-structure representation,
          as is the case with the <ref target="http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/html/">MULTEXT-East
          tagset</ref>. For these, it is best to use the generic <att>ana</att> attribute, as
          shown in the following example:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis2">
            <s>
              <w ana="#Pd-nsg" lemma="ta">Tega</w>
              <w ana="#Px------y" lemma="se">se</w>
              <w ana="#Q" lemma="sploh">sploh</w>
              <w ana="#Va-r1s-y" lemma="biti">nisem</w>
              <w ana="#Vmep-sm" lemma="zavesti" join="right">zavedel</w>
              <pc ana="#Z">.</pc>
            </s>
          </egXML>
          
          Here, the tags are simply pointers to identifiers, where the elements bearing these
          identifiers define the appropriate feature-structures, i.e. pairs of attribute-values,
          as in the example below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis3">

              <f name="Number"><symbol value="singular"/></f>

          segmental annotation, where a stretch of text or tokens is simply enclosed in XML

          TEI offers a number of elements that can be used for such annotations,
          e.g.:

          In the example, each token, as well as the sentence element are given an ID, and the
          first link group specifies the Universal Dependencies syntactic analysis of the
          sentence, while the second one give its semantic role labels.  They are distinguished
          by their <att>type</att> attribute<note>We do not specify the values of
          <att>type</att> of the link gropu as the range of possibilities is too great and not
          known in advance.</note>, while the <att>targFunc</att> attribute explains the
          functions of the references given in the <att>target</att> attributes of the contained
          <gi>link</gi> elements.</p>
          
          <p>The contained links then give the references to the head and argument tokens of
          the relation, while the <att>ana</att> attribute specifies what kind of a relation
          this is. It should be noted that the value of the analysis attribute is a pointer,
          and, in the example, we use the TEI prefix mechanism, which is then expanded via the
          <gi>prefixDef</gi> element in the TEI header to resolve into a URI pointer (as
          explained in Section on <ref target="#sec-idents">Identifiers and referencing</ref>),
          most likely to pointing to <gi>taxonomy</gi> categories that give the definitions of
          the relations. A further point to notice is that the sentence serves as the Root
          element of the sentence, i.e. the fifth link of the UD analysis ties together the
          sentence with the top-most token of the sentence.</p>

        <p>Parliamentary corpora can also have data from other modalities associated with the
        transcripts, in particular audio or video recordings, and the facsimile of the original
        transcripts, particularly relevant for older parliamentary proceedings. This section
        explains how to encode such data in the TEI encoded documents, where it is assumed that
        the actual speech, video and images are stored in separate files, and the TEI document
        makes reference to them.</p>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-speechvideo">
          <head>Speech and video</head>
          
          <p>The transcription can refer to and align with external audio and video data using
          the <gi>timeline</gi> element, explained in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.html#SASYMP">Placing
          Synchronous Events in Time</ref> of the TEI Guidelines, and further elaborated in
          <ref target="https://www.iso.org/standard/37338.html">ISO 24624:2016 Language
          resource management -- Transcription of spoken language</ref>. While the ISO standard
          is better elaborated, it also changes and adds element definitions, so we are using
          the standard TEI variant of speech encoding as far as the schema is concerned, while
          taking into account, as much as possible, specific encoding choices as proposed by
          the ISO standard.</p>
          
          <p>First, TEI offers the <gi>recordingStmt</gi> element (a part of <gi>fileDesc</gi>
          of the TEI header) which contains the information about the recording(s) of the
          transcription. This information can be unstructured (i.e. a series of <gi>ab</gi>
          elements) or structured (contained in the <gi>recording</gi> element); Parla-CLARIN
          recommends the structured version. As shown in the example below, the element
          contains information of the type of recording (audio / video), its duration<note>The
          <att>dur</att> values should follow the <ref
          target="https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/#duration">W3C
          datatype</ref>.</note> and a pointer to the file, possibly a responsibility statement
          (<gi>respStmt</gi>) of the person or agency that made the recording, the date when
          the recording file was made and the equipment used:

          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>The mapping of time intervals of the recording to IDs in the TEI document is
          encoded in the <gi>timeline</gi> element, in particular in the contained
          <gi>when</gi> elements. As explained below, these IDs are then used to link elements
          in the transcription to the timeline, therefore each <gi>when</gi> element must have
          the <att>xml:id</att> attribute. The <gi>when</gi> elements must also be in the same
          order as the time-points they encode.</p>
          
          <p>As the example below shows, the timeline gives the unit in which the intervals are
          specified (typically second, <code>s</code>) and the time origin of the timeline,
          here referring to the first <gi>when</gi> element, at the very start of the
          recording, so specified with the absolute time.  Further <gi>when</gi> elements give
          the interval between this origin point and their end:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-timeline">
            <timeline unit="s" origin="#T0">
              <when xml:id="T0" absolute="00:00:00.0"/>
              <when xml:id="T1" interval="1.13" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T2" interval="3.84" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T3" interval="5.33" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T4" interval="9.35" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T5" interval="12.62" since="#T0"/>
            </timeline>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>The IDs of the timeline synchronisation are then used by elements in the
          transcription (e.g. <gi>u</gi> or <gi>seg</gi>) via their <att>start</att> and
          <att>end</att> attributes. In the examples below we see three cases of such linking:
          the first one gives a straightforward temporal structure; the second one uses the
          empty <gi>anchor</gi> element to give additional temporal structure for cases where
          the synchronised parts of the utterance are not further marked-up; and the third and
          fourth demonstrate the case where two utterances are partially overlapping:<note>Note
          that in such cases we would also use the <att>prev</att> and <att>next</att>
          attributes, as shown in the <ref target="#exa-splitu">Example on split
          utterances</ref>.</note>:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-utiming">

          <p>Especially for older parliamentary proceedings, where the exact appearance of the
          original proceedings is of interest, it can be advantageous to also enable viewing
          the facsimile together with the transcription. How to achieve this in general is
          explained in the <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html">Chapter on
          Representation of Primary Sources</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>
          
          <p>The simplest but also the most limiting way to achieve this is to have per-page
          facsimile files and use the page break i.e. <gi>pb</gi> element to mark page
          boundaries in the transcript and then directly specify the image file of the page
          with the <att>facs</att> attribute, as illustrated in the example below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-pb">
            <body>
              <pb facs="PNG/page1.png"/>
              <!-- text contained on page 1 encoded here -->
              <pb facs="PNG/page2.png"/>
              <!-- text contained on page 2 encoded here -->
            </body>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>By convention, this encoding indicates that the image indicated by the <att>facs</att>
          attribute represents the whole of the text following the <gi>pb</gi> element, up
          to the next <gi>pb</gi> element.</p>
          
          <p>A more complicated solution, where it is possible to have several images per page
          (e.g. in different resolutions) or to specify areas of a page is enabled by the
          <gi>facsimile</gi> element, which should appear immediately before the <gi>text</gi>
          element of a TEI document. The example below refers to the first and third pages
          directly with the <gi>graphic</gi> element, whereas the second page is encoded as a
          <gi>surface</gi> which then contains the page image in two resolutions:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-facsimile">
            <facsimile>
              <graphic xml:id="page1" url="PNG/page1.png"/>
              <surface xml:id="page2">
                <graphic type="600dpi" url="PNG/page2-highRes.png"/>
                <graphic type="300dpi" url="PNG/page2-lowRes.png"/>
              </surface>
              <graphic xml:id="page3" url="PNG/page3.png"/>
            </facsimile>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>More complicated cases, such as delimiting portions of a page are also supported
          by the TEI Guidelines, and for these the reader is referred directly to the Section
          on <ref

        <p>A TEI encoded document is, in general, not meant to be used directly by software
        programs, rather it serves as an interchange and storage format.  Furthermore, most TEI
        documents are not "born TEI", but rather converted into TEI from some source format.
        In this section we discuss some up- and down-conversion scripts that have already been
        developed for transforming source formats into Parla-CLARIN and from Parla-CLARIN into
        formats immediately usable by software and are available in the Git repository of
        Parla-CLARIN.</p>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-convakn">
          <head>Conversion from Akoma Ntoso</head>
          <p>As mentioned in the Section on <ref target="#sec-akoma">Introducing Akoma
          Ntoso</ref>, this standard is used to encode parliamentary proceedings of several
          countries, and this section introduces the developed conversion of AKN documents to
          Parla-CLARIN. The example documents and conversion script can be found in the
          <code>Examples/AkomaNtoso</code> folder of the Parla-CLARIN Git repository. For a
          detailed treatment of the conversion, the XSLT script <code>akn2tei.xsl</code> should
          be consulted, while we here mention only some of the more aspects of the
          conversion.</p>

          <p>First, and on a minor point, the conversion to TEI attempts to preserve the IDs of
          the source AKN document, however, Akoma Ntoso distinguishes three ID-bearing
          attributes, namely <att>eId</att> (expression identifier), <att>wId</att> (work
          identifier) and <att>GUID</att> (globally unique identifier). The first is simply
          mapped to the <att>xml:id</att> attribute of the TEI document, while the latter two
          are given in the <gi>publicationStmt</gi> of the TEI header and in the 
          <gi>idno</gi> element, as the following example illustrates:

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-id">
            <idno type="wId" corresp="#section_2_1">section_2_2</idno>
            <idno type="GUID" corresp="#section_2_2">X13242</idno>

            <head>FRBR data</head>

            <gi>identification</gi> element, which appears inside the <gi>meta</gi> element, as
            shown in the example below:

              </identification>
            </egXML>
            
            Some of these elements are mapped to specific TEI elements or attributes, e.g. the
            language of the text specified in the <gi>FRBRExpression</gi> maps to the
            <att>xml:lang</att> of the <gi>TEI</gi> element, but this does not hold for all the
            FRBR information, which we also wanted to retain in the TEI document.</p>
            
            <p>To convert all FRBR information to TEI, we used the recommendations of <ref
            target="https://tei-c.org/extra/teiinlibraries/">Best Practices for TEI in
            Libraries</ref>, in particular as given the Section on <ref
            target="https://tei-c.org/extra/teiinlibraries/4.0.0/bptl-driver.html#frbr">The TEI
            Header and FRBR</ref>,<note>Encoding FRBR in TEI is (at greater length than in the

            #64</ref> of Best-Practices-for-TEI-in-Libraries GitHub repository.</note> where
            it is recommended that FRBR information is encoded in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi>
            element of the TEI header as a <gi>listRelation</gi>. As opposed to the original
            AKN <gi>identification</gi> the <gi>listRelation</gi> contains a simple list of
            <gi>relation</gi> elements, so these must also specify the relation between the
            particular piece of data and the fact that it belongs to the FRBR <q>work</q>,
            <q>expression</q>, or <q>manifestation</q>. These and other formalised relations
            are taken from the formal vocabularies of <ref
            target="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</ref> (for RDF and OWL) and (via <ref

            There are few points to notice in this conversion:
            <list>
              <item>Where AKN qualifies its FRBR statements with the additional <att>name</att>
              attribute, which does not have a controlled vocabulary, its value is retained in
              the <att>name</att> attribute of the TEI <gi>relation</gi>.</item>

              <item>The conversion also specifies the formal equivalence (OWL
              <code>sameAs</code>) of the official FRBR definition of <q>work</q>,
              <q>expression</q>, and <q>manifestation</q> (so, <ref
              target="http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/">http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/</ref>) with the
              AKN recommended ontology of these terms, namely <ref
              target="https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot">https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot/</ref>.</item>
            </list>
          </p>
        </div>

          <div xml:id="sec-convakn-qa">
            <head>Converting addressee, role, questions and answers</head>
            <p>Akoma Ntoso can directly specify not only the speaker of an utterance (as the
            value of the <att>by</att> attribute) but also the role of the speaker for a
            particular utterance (<att>as</att> attribute) and to whom the speech is addressed
            to (<att>to</att> attribute), as exemplified below:
            
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-to">
              <speech by="#khalwale" to="#speaker" as="#pm">
                <p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give notice of the following Motion:-</p>
                ...
              </speech>
            </egXML>

            TEI does not have attributes directly corresponding to the AKN <att>as</att> and
            <att>to</att>, so the former is encoded as the value of the general <att>ana</att>
            attribute, which should point to the appropriate <gi>category</gi> of the pertinent
            ontology, while the latter is encoded (as also discussed in the Section on <ref
            target="#sec-relation">Relationships between people and parties</ref>) as a
            <gi>relation</gi> element with the <att>name</att> value <code>directedTo</code>
            which should be included in the utterance to which it is pertinent, as exemplified
            below:

            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-totei">
              <u who="#khalwale" ana="#pm">
                <seg>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give notice of the following Motion:-</seg>
                ...
                <listRelation>
                  <relation name="directedTo" active="#khalwale" passive="#speaker"/>
                </listRelation>
              </u>
            </egXML>
            </p>
            
            <p>A similar problem, and its solution, concerns the distinction made in Akoma
            Ntoso between questions and answers, each of which has in AKN a dedicated element,
            as shown in the following example:
            
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-qa">
              <question eId="question_1" by="#kappa" to="#ministerEducation">
                <p>Mr. Kappa asked the Minister for Education and ...</p>
              </question>
              <answer eId="answer_1" by="#eta" as="#ministerEducation">
                <p>Mr. Speaker, BNAT was the only umbrella professional body for...</p>
              </answer>
            </egXML>

            In the conversion to TEI the relation between the questions and its answer is also
            expressed as a <gi>relation</gi> element, but this time using <att>name</att> with
            the value <code>questionAnswer</code>. Furthermore, the <gi>listRelation</gi> is
            placed in an arbitrary portion of the document, as it contains links to IDs;
            however, by convention it is best to place it after the answer. We exemplify below:
            
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-qa-tei">
              <u xml:id="question_1" who="#kappa">

                <listRelation>
                  <relation name="directedTo" active="#kappa" passive="#ministerEducation"/>
                </listRelation>
              </u>
              <u xml:id="answer_1" who="#eta" ana="#ministerEducation">
                <seg>Mr. Speaker, BNAT was the only umbrella professional body for ...</seg>
              </u>
              <listRelation>
                <relation name="questionAnswer" active="#question_1" passive="#answer_1"/>

          <head>Conversion to RDF</head>
          <p>As explained in the Section on <ref target="#sec-rdf">Introducing
          RDF</ref>, this data model would be a useful <q>down-conversion</q> of
          Parla-CLARIN corpora.</p>
          
          <p>On the tei-l mailing list there have already been discussions on how to
          link TEI with RDF, summarised and with further links in <ref
          target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1860">Issue #1860</ref> of the
          <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/">TEI GitHub project</ref>.
          The best way seems to be to either directly turn TEI markup into RDF triples,
          or, where this is not possible, to use the RDFa attribute on TEI elements.</p>

          <p>An implementation might be best approached from the opposite direction,
          i.e. developing an <q>up-conversion</q> to TEI of an existing RDF-encoded
          CPP.</p>
