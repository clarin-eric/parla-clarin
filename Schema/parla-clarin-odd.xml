        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>Parliamentary proceedings corpora (PPCs) are a quintessential resource for a wide
        range of research questions from a number of SSH disciplines, such as history and
        sociolinguistics. Their most distinguishing characteristic is that they are
        (typically edited) transcriptions of spoken language produced in controlled and
        regulated circumstances. They are also rich in invaluable (sociodemographic)
        metadata as well as easily available under the Freedom of Information Acts set in
        place to enable informed participation by the public and to improve effective
        functioning of democratic systems, making the datasets even more valuable.</p>
        
        <p>Given these reasons and the fact that parliamentary proceedings are often
        available on-line, many researchers have already compiled corpora of parliamentary
        proceedings.  However, these corpora are encoded in a variety of different annotation
        schemes, limiting their interchange and re-use.</p>
        
        <p>In order to overcome this problem, the presented recommendations, called
        Parla-CLARIN, propose a schema that can be used for encoding of parliamentary
        proceedings corpora, primarily for the purposes of scholarly investigations,
        and that could serve as a storage and interchange format for such corpora. These
        recommendations attempt to take into account the following aspects of PPC:
        <list>
          <item>Structure: legislative periods, sessions, topics, speeches, transcription variants</item>
          <item>Metadata: mandates, titles, parliamentary bodies, locations, dates
          and times</item>
          <item>Speakers: sex, date of birth, education, party membership, links to external
          resources</item>
          <item>Political parties: name(s), history, relations</item>
          <item>Speeches: speaker, text, comments, verbal interruptions, (non-)verbal incidents</item>
          <item>Linguistic annotation: PoS tagging, normalisation, syntax etc.</item>
          <item>Multimedia: audio and video, facsimile of original</item>
        </list>
        </p>
        
        <p>The recommendations are implemented as a parameterisation of the
        <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">TEI
        Guidelines</ref>, which are XML-based recommendations for encoding texts for scholarly
        purposes. As opposed to most other such recommendations, the TEI Guidelines have the
        ambition to be applicable to texts in any natural language, of any date, in any
        literary genre or text type, without restriction on form or content. The TEI
        parameterisation proposed for Parla-CLARIN also allows a wide range of PPC to be encoded,
        while making explicit recommendations on the manner of encoding various
        phenomena. The recommendations are written as a TEI ODD document, on the
        basis of which it is possible to derive an XML schema expressed either as a RelaxNG
        schema, a DTD or a W3C schema.</p>

        <p>When using these recommendations, the following points should be taken in consideration:
        <list>

          <item>The TEI Guidelines are a large and complex set of specifications, and the
          Parla-CLARIN recommendations do not attempt to give an introduction to them. Rather,
          it concentrates only on aspects of the Guidelines that are most likely to be of use
          in encoding PPCs.</item>
          
          <item>It is difficult if not impossible to determine in advance what research
          questions a developer of a PPC will want to ask, and so what kind of phenomena they
          will want to encode. While we tried to cater for the more obvious encoding needs, it
          is possible that new users will have to use TEI elements or attributes that are not
          mentioned here.</item>

          <item>Since these recommendations are very much work in progress, we have left the formal
          specification (i.e. the XML schema) rather unconstrained, so it can accommodate
          encoding practices that we have not (yet) foreseen. The downside of this is that the
          XML schemas will allow constructs that are at odds with those that we propose in the
          prose of the recommendations. Therefore, the prose should be taken as the definitive
          way of encoding the phenomena under discussion, i.e. even if a PPC validates against
          the schema, it might still not be encoded according to these recommendations.</item>

          <item>In the text of these recommendations, every mention of an element is linked to
          its definition, where examples of use are also given. The text also makes frequent
          references to the text of the TEI Guidelines. However, the TEI
          Guidelines give generic examples and explanations, which can be at odds with 
          particular recommendations that are made here, so the ones from the TEI Guidelines
	  should be taken with a grain of salt.</item>

        </list>
        </p>
        
        <p>The rest of these recommendations are structured as follows:

        <div xml:id="sec-scope">
          <head>Scope and purpose</head>
          <p>These recommendations consist of guidelines, a formal TEI schema, and derived
          XML schemas in various schema languages. They are intended for the encoding of
          corpora of parliamentary proceedings, regardless of the language or country of
          origin, for the purposes of scholarly investigations, be they from the field of
          linguistics, political science, history or other humanities and social sciences
          disciplines. The recommendations are, in principle, not meant as the primary
          storage format of parliamentary proceedings, such as kept by governmental
          offices, for which <ref target="#sec-akoma">Akoma Ntoso</ref> might be 
          preferred.</p>
          
          <p>In developing a schema for structuring data, two approaches can be adopted: a
          descriptive one, where as much as possible of the original data distinctions are kept
          in the target encoding; or a prescriptive one, where the target encoding is severely
          constrained, to enable seamless data interchange and esp. interoperability with
          software tools. The Parla-CLARIN recommendations adopt the <emph>descriptive</emph>
          approach, as the source data, time and effort devoted to converting it, the intended
          applications, as well as country-specific rules of parliamentary proceedings will
          differ considerably, and it is likely that any prescriptive schema would soon turn
          out to be too restrictive. Nevertheless, the recommendations do try to limit the
          plethora of encoding options otherwise available in TEI to those that could be
          sensibly applied to corpora of parliamentary proceedings, and where more than one
          option is available in TEI to encode a given phenomenon, the schema and especially
          the text guidelines attempt to recommend only one option.</p>

          <p>It should be noted that for those preferring a prescriptive approach, the <ref
          target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint">ParlaMint</ref> corpora and their
          schema should be consulted, which are interoperable and are accompanied by a number
          of scripts to validate and convert the corpora. But, while the ParlaMint corpora do
          contain rich (meta)data, they nevertheless support a more restricted view on encoding
          parliamentary proceedings than does Parla-CLARIN.</p>

            <p>The Parla-CLARIN proposal is developed as a project of the <ref
            target="https://www.clarin.eu/">CLARIN</ref> European Research Infrastructure for
            Language Resources and Technology. Before the beginning of this development, CLARIN
            had already organised a number of initiatives and events that deal with
            parliamentary corpora:
            <list>
              <item>CLARIN Traveling Campus <q>Talk of Europe</q>, where three <q>Creative
              Camps</q> were organised in 2014 and 2015 and which used the proceedings of
              the European Parliament, curated as
              <ref target="https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-x62-ew3m">linked open data</ref></item>
              <item>CLARIN-PLUS cross-disciplinary workshop

            </list>
            At these events, it became clear that existing parliamentary corpora are
            encoded in many different ways, presenting a barrier to their
            interchange. Therefore the CLARIN Interoperability Committee organised a
            focused
            <q><ref target="https://www.clarin.eu/blog/clarin-parlaformat-workshop">CLARIN
            ParlaFormat</ref></q> workshop (May 23-24, 2019, Amersfoort) with selected
            participants at which the idea of the Parla-CLARIN recommendations were introduced,
            the participants presented their own experiences with encoding parliamentary
            corpora and gave their comments to the draft proposal.

            </p>
            <p>After the initial publication of Parla-CLARIN, the
            <ref target="https://www.clarin.eu/content/parlamint-towards-comparable-parliamentary-corpora">ParlaMint</ref>
            project developed corpora of 17 European parliaments, encoded to a specialisation
            of the Parla-CLARIN recommendations. As the ParlaMint corpora follow a much
            stricter encoding, they are also interoperable, and samples of the corpora, the
            schema used, and various scripts to process the corpora are available from the
            <ref target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint">ParlaMint GitHub</ref>
            repository, while the complete corpora can be found on the
            <ref target="https://www.clarin.si/repository/xmlui/">CLARIN.SI repository</ref>.
            Certain decisions taken in the encoding of the ParlaMint corpora have
            also had an impact on the current Parla-CLARIN recommendations.
            </p>

          <div xml:id="sec-akoma">
            <head>Akoma Ntoso</head>
            <p>While there are a large number of recommendations and standards that could in
            principle be used to encode parliamentary proceedings, the <ref
            target="http://www.akomantoso.org/">Akoma Ntoso</ref> standard stands out in that
            it was explicitly developed as an XML format for encoding legislative and judiciary
            documents including parliamentary proceedings. Akoma Ntoso is an OASIS standard and
            has already been used to encode various legal documents in a number of
            countries. It defines an <ref
            target="http://docs.oasis-open.org/legaldocml/akn-core/v1.0/os/part1-vocabulary/akn-core-v1.0-os-part1-vocabulary.html">XML
            schema</ref> for modelling for legal documents (called AKN), uses <ref
            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records">FRBR
            concepts</ref> and has a built-in relation to ontologies.</p>

            <p>It is thus a reasonable question why CLARIN did not simply adopt AKN, rather
            than developing a conceptually very different encoding schema.
            The main reasons for this are the following:
            <list>

              <item>Unfamiliarity of corpus compilers and users with AKN, and relatively
              good familiarity with TEI: for example, of the 16 talks presenting PPCs at the <ref
              target="https://www.clarin.eu/event/2019/parlaformat-workshop">CLARIN ParlaFormat
              workshop</ref>, 10 used a TEI encoding, or an encoding <q>inspired by TEI</q>. It
              should also be noted that for most corpus compiler PPCs will be only one type of
              the corpora they will be compiling, so it is somewhat unrealistic for them to learn
              AKN and develop conversion scripts from it for just one type of corpus; on the
              other hand, TEI can be used for practically any type of corpus.</item>

              <item>AKN makes no provisions for storing speaker meta-data, which is rather
              accessed from external data sources and using a specialised referencing system; on
              the other hand, TEI has a number of elements for recording details about
              persons. For reasons of completeness, uniform and easier processing, and
              experimental replicability it is better to include these data directly in the
              corpus.</item>

              <item>AKN has no built-in support for linguistic annotation (apart from named
              entities). And while it would be possible to add elements for such annotation via
              a different namespace to AKN, AKN has no provisions for extending its schema,
              while TEI already has such elements available. As the main purpose of this
              proposal is to cater for linguistic analyses of parliamentary proceedings, TEI
              seems a better choice.</item>
              
            </list>
            
            Nevertheless, AKN is an important schema for modelling parliamentary proceedings,
            and some solutions of AKN were used in developing the Parla-CLARIN proposal, in
            particular the typology of divisions of a document. Also developed was a (partial)
            conversion for AKN to Parla-CLARIN, which covers some example documents, further
            discussed in the Section on the <ref target="#sec-convakn">Conversion from Akoma
            Ntoso</ref>.</p>
          </div>

          <div xml:id="sec-rdf">
            <head>RDF</head>

            <p>The Resource Description Framework (<ref
            target="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</ref>) is a W3C specification and a standard model
            for computer-processable data interchange on the Web. It is also the base format for
            modelling information in the context of Linked Open Data (<ref
            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">LOD</ref>), an influential model
            for linking data on the Web. And while LOD data is typically not concerned with
            language data, there is also the <q>Linguistic Linked Open Data Cloud</q> (<ref
            target="http://linguistic-lod.org/llod-cloud">LLOD</ref>) initiative which is
            explicitly targeted towards language resources. RDF/LOD has also been quite popular
            for modelling parliamentary debates (e.g. the already mentioned <ref
            target="https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-x62-ew3m">Talk of Europe</ref> LOD dataset),
            so, again, the question arises why not use RDF to encode such data, rather than
            developing a TEI-based solution.</p>

            <p>In this case, the answer is, at least partially, to do with the community addressed
            by the Parla-CLARIN recommendations and the preferences of this community: while LOD
            is targeted to computer scientists and the concept of a machine-processable and
            linked Word-Wide Web, TEI much more addresses researchers from (digital) humanities
            and of internally complete resources. In practical terms, this is seen in the
            difference between RDF encoded data, which is machine processable but hardly human
            readable or editable and highly connected to external data sources, while TEI
            documents are relatively self-explanatory, esp. after some exposure to the TEI
            Guidelines, can be edited in any XML editor and mostly self-contained. And while
            there exists the LLOD initiative that addresses linguistic annotation, the initiative
            seems to have lost momentum, and also has other concerns to addressing detailed
            encoding of a particular type of language resources - in fact, the same can be said
            for most RDF attempts at encoding parliamentary data, which encode only rather
            shallow aspects of such data.</p>

            <p>But while this specification does not see RDF data as the ideal framework to
            encode parliamentary proceedings corpora for storage and interchange, it does take RDF
            as a useful down-stream model for exploiting such corpora, i.e. developing a TEI to
            RDF conversion is a concern, which is taken further in the Section on the <ref
            target="#sec-conrdf">Conversion to RDF</ref>.</p>

        <p>A Parla-CLARIN corpus should, in general, capture as much of the text and markup
        from the source as possible, while the presence of graphical items or other elements
        that could not or were not transcribed should be indicated by markup, in particular
        with the use of <gi>gap</gi> as further explained in the Section on
        <ref target="#sec-gaps">Gaps</ref>.</p>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-chars">
          <head>Characters</head>
          
          <p>The corpus should be encoded in Unicode, using the UTF-8 character encoding, at
          least for European languages.  In cases where the original contains characters from
          the Unicode Private Use Area, these should, if possible, be given their closest
          Unicode equivalents, or substituted by the Unicode replacement character
          U+FFFD.<note>TEI supports preserving the original Private Use Area codepoints by
          using the <gi>g</gi> element, which is further explained in the Section on
          <ref target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/WD.html">Characters,
          Glyphs, and Writing Modes</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. However, such characters will
          rarely if ever be used in PPCs, so the current Parla-CLARIN proposal does not include
          the gaiji module which allows the use of this element - if they are needed, then the
          Parla-CLARIN ODD needs to be changed.</note></p>
          
          <p>End-of-line hyphens can be removed, and the split words joined in order to enhance
          searching the corpus and to simplify linguistic processing. It is recommended that
          this practice is documented in the TEI header of the corpus, in the
          <gi>hyphenation</gi> element as explained in the Section on
          <ref target="#sec-document">Documenting the encoding process</ref>.</p>
          
          <p>The following characters, esp. prevalent when the source documents were in Word or
          HTML, deserve special mention:
          
          <list>
            <item>TAB (U+0009) character helps the alignment of strings on successive
            lines.  As Parla-CLARIN is not interested in preserving the details of the
            layout, it is recommended that tab characters are substituted by the 
            space character (U+0020).</item>
            
            <item>NO-BREAK SPACE (U+00A0) prevents, with some applications, an automatic
            line break at its position and collapsing consecutive such space characters
            into a single space. As the use of this character complicates (or breaks)
            further processing, esp. linguistic annotation, it is recommended that these
            characters are substituted by the normal space character (U+0020). The same
            holds for other variants of spaces (U+2000 - U+200A), which are, however,
            used much less frequently.</item>
            
            <item>NON-BREAKING HYPHEN (U+2011), similarly to NO-BREAK SPACE, prevents a
            line break, in this case following its position. With a similiar reasoning as
            above, and, additionally, complicates searching, it is recommended that this
            character is substituted by the normal hyphen character ('-', U+002D).</item>
            
            <item>SOFT HYPHEN (U+00AD) indicates that a word can be hyphenated at that
            point. Occurrences of this character should be removed from the corpus.</item>
          </list>
          </p>
          
          <p>While not required, it is sensible to also normalise sequences of whitespace
          characters into a single space or end-of-line character. Again, this simplifies
          further (esp. linguistic) processing.</p>

        <div xml:id="sec-langs">
          <head>Languages</head>
          <p>The language of an element's text content is in TEI, as in XML, signaled by the
          value of its <att>xml:lang</att> attribute.  The Parla-CLARIN recommendations require
          that each element that contains text is either marked by this attribute, or one of
          its ancestors is; in particular, the root element of the corpus should always have an
          <att>xml:lang</att> attribute. For multilingual documents (excluding cases where only
          a minor part of the text is in another language), the language code of the root
          element should be <q>mul</q> for <q>multiple languages</q>. Note that if going by
          the ancestor axis, the values of two <att>xml:lang</att> are in conflict, the one
          closer to the context node is relevant one.
          </p>
          
          <p>The values of <att>xml:lang</att> should follow <ref
          target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP 47</ref>, cf. also <q><ref
          target="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-when-xmllang">xml:lang in XML
          document schemas</ref></q>.</p>
          
          <p>It is good practice to document the languages used in the <gi>langUsage</gi>
          element of the TEI header. The language names can be given in more than one
          language, and, when more languages are used in the transcriptions, the
          percentage of their use can also be indicated in the <att>usage</att> element of
          the <gi>language</gi> elements, as illustrated in the example below.
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-langusage">
            <langUsage>
              <language ident="en" xml:lang="en">English</language>
              <language ident="en" xml:lang="nl">Engels</language>
              <language usage="45" ident="nl" xml:lang="en">Dutch</language>
              <language usage="45" ident="nl" xml:lang="nl">Nederlands</language>
              <language usage="55" ident="fr" xml:lang="en">French</language>
              <language usage="55" ident="fr" xml:lang="nl">Frans</language>
            </langUsage>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>Apart from the above considerations, a related question is where to draw the line
          between the object and meta languages, i.e. the language of the corpus and the
          language of the markup. The TEI defines the names of the elements and attributes in
          English, and the language of the corpus will, of course, depend on the country of the
          parliament. It is less straightforward to decide in which language the attribute
          values (such as the values of the <att>type</att> attribute) should be. Parla-CLARIN
          recommends that these should also be in English.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-idents">
          <head>Identifiers and referencing</head>
          <p>In order to simply refer to elements of a TEI document (i.e. a Parla-CLARIN
          corpus), elements can be marked with an ID, i.e. given the <att>xml:id</att> attribute
          with a unique value, obeying certain format requirements as defined by
          <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-id/">W3C</ref>.</p>
          
          <p>Parla-CLARIN requires an <att>xml:id</att> attribute on the root element of
          each corpus file, which should, furthermore, be identical to the filename (modulo
          the file extension).  Parla-CLARIN also recommends that the divisions of the
          document (element <gi>div</gi>) should also be given identifiers. While any
          element can be given an <att>xml:id</att>, this is, in general, not a good idea;
          rather, only those elements that will or could be referenced should be marked with
          this attribute.</p>
          
          <p>TEI offers a number of attributes that contain (URI) pointers.  Where the reference
          is to an element inside the document, the value of the <att>xml:id</att> being
          referred to should be preceded by a hash (#), as mandated by the XML standard. If the
          ID pointed to is from another document, then the full URI needs to be used.</p>
	  
          <p>However, as such URIs can be very long, TEI also offers another way of pointing, which
	  can be used to shorten such long URIs, and this is defined by the <gi>prefixDef</gi>
	  element in the TEI header, as illustrated below:

	  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-prefixDef">
            <prefixDef ident="mte" matchPattern="(.+)" 
                       replacementPattern="http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/tables/msd-fslib-sl.xml#$1">
              <p xml:lang="en">Private URIs with this prefix point to feature-structure elements defining the Slovenian MULTEXT-East Version 6 MSDs.</p>
            </prefixDef>
          </egXML>

	  With such a definition, we can use much shorter pointers in the markup of words,
	  such as <val>mte:Pd-nsg</val>, which are then, via a regular expression mapping in the
	  prefix definition, converted to the full URI <val>http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/tables/msd-fslib-sl.xml#Pd-nsg</val>.
          </p>
	</div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-temporal">
          <head>Temporal information</head>
          <p>Parliamentary corpora can contain significant time-related information, e.g. the
          date and time of a sitting, the start and end of an MP's affiliation to a particular
          party, the dates of the beginning and end of a political party etc. In general, such
          information in TEI is stored in the attributes of the pertinent element, which take
          as their values a date and possibly time, according to the ISO 8601 Date and Time
          Formats, and specified in the <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/">XML
          Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition</ref>. TEI offers a very rich set of
          attributes and ancillary elements to specify time-related information, which are
          discussed in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#CONADA">Dates
          and Times</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>

          <p>Parla-CLARIN users are free to use any of the TEI temporal attributes and
          elements, however, for most purposes, the following five attributes will suffice:
          <list>
            <item><att>when</att>: when a certain event happened;</item>
            <item><att>from</att>, <att>to</att>: the start and end of an event or state;</item>
            <item><att>notBefore</att>, <att>notAfter</att>: the earliest and latest known
            time that an event or state took place, used in cases where the exact time
            is not known.</item>
          </list>
          </p>
          <p>To illustrate, we give below two elements that are marked with temporal attributes.
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-temporal">

        <div xml:id="sec-files">
          <head>Files</head>
          <p>While these recommendations make the assumption that a complete PPC is one TEI XML
          document, this does not mean that it also has to be stored in one file, as the file
          structure is distinct from the concept of XML documents. To enable one XML document
          to be composed of many files, the <ref
          target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">XInclude</ref> mechanism should be
          used. Typically, a corpus will then be composed of a file containing the root XML
          element and the corpus header, while individual text files will be included in the
          corpus using the <gi>include</gi> element from the XInclude namespace, as illustrated
          by the following example:

          <eg xml:id="exa-xinclude">

          </eg>
          </p>
          
          <p>As mentioned, we recommend that the file has the same name as the value of the
          <att>xml:id</att> attribute of the root element of the file. This e.g. guarantees
          that each file of the corpus has a unique name.</p>

          size and granularity of parliamentary proceedings corpora, not to mention
          the national rules of structuring the workings of the parliament, differ
          substantially. Typically, however, an individual <gi>TEI</gi> element
          contains one sitting or session or one day, in any case such data that has

          <p>As illustrated below, the <gi>text</gi> element can, apart from the obligatory

          <p>In the text <gi>body</gi>, as well as in the <gi>front</gi> and <gi>back</gi>
          matter, the element that further organises the content into sections is the division,
          <gi>div</gi>, and each of the three text-bearing elements (if present) should
          contain at least one division.</p>

          <p>The divisions can be nested, as shown in the example below:
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-divsimple">
            <body>
              <div>

                <div>
                  <head>Representation of members of the Federal Government</head>
                  ...
                </div>
                <div>
                  <head>Hour of topical interest</head>
                  ...
                </div>
                <div>
                  <head>Announcement of an urgent request</head>
                  ...
                </div>
              </div>
            </body>
          </egXML>
          In general it is a complicated question what should constitute a division of a
          transcription, with the pragmatic solution being that a division will be whatever has
          a heading (than can be recognised by the up-conversion software) in the source
          transcription.</p>

          <p>The divisions can be further characterised by their <att>type</att> and, possibly,
          <att>subtype</att> attributes. The use of these attributes makes sense in cases where
          the source either explicitly (e.g. via its structure, as in Akoma Ntoso) or
          implicitly (e.g. via pattern matching the content of the headings) indicates what
          kind of a division it is. For example:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-divtype">
            <body>
              <div>
                ...
                <div type="representation">
                  <head>Representation of members of the Federal Government</head>
                  ...
                </div>
                <div type="topical">
                  <head>Hour of topical interest</head>
                  ...
                </div>
                <div type="request">
                  <head>Announcement of an urgent request</head>
                  ...
                </div>
              </div>
            </body>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>If used, the values of the <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> attributes will
          depend on the parliamentary rules of the particular country, on the need to
          distinguish the types of divisions, as well as on the ability to automatically
          recognise them or the available effort to manually add them. The Parla-CLARIN
          specification does therefore not enforce the use of these attributes nor does it
          restrict their values.  However, the definition of <gi>div</gi> does give a set of
          sample values for <att>type</att>, which correspond to the names of the structure
          elements defined by <ref target="#sec-akoma">Akoma Ntoso</ref>. Below we give an
          example of a relatively complex structure made on the basis of an Akoma
          Ntoso document, where the <att>subtype</att> attribute encodes the values of the
          corresponding <att>name</att> attribute of AKN:

        <div xml:id="sec-docvariants">
          <head>Document variants</head>
          <p>Parliamentary proceedings often exist in two versions, the original,
          <q>raw</q> transcription, and the edited, <q>redacted</q> transcription, which
          is then published. If both versions can be available, it is interesting for some
          research questions to also have both versions transcriptions available for study
          in the scope of a PPC.</p>

          <p>TEI offers a number of options on how to encode variant texts, most of them
          discussed in the <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.htm">Chapter on
          Linking, Segmentation, and Alignment</ref>. We here present the simplest option,
          where it is assumed that each transcription exists in a separate TEI document
          and that the segments that should be aligned between the raw and redacted
          transcriptions are explicitly marked up in the text. As shown in the example
          below, which gives one segment from the file <code>trans-raw.xml</code>
          and one from the file <code>trans-red.xml</code> it is in this case
          enough to specify the <att>xml:id</att> on both elements and use the
          <att>corresp</att> attribute to point to the aligned segment:

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-variants">
            <!-- From trans-raw.xml: -->
            <seg xml:id="raw.1" corresp="trans-red.xml#red.1">What did, uh, who say that?</seg>

            <!-- From trans-red.xml: -->
            <seg xml:id="red.1" corresp="trans-raw.xml#raw.1">Who said that?</seg>
          </egXML>
          It should be noted that the relation between the aligned elements does not need
          to be 1-1: if the relation is 0-1 or 1-0, then the non-aligned element is simply
          not given in a <att>corresp</att>; if the relation is n-1 or 1-n, then several
          IDs are given as values of the <att>corresp</att> attribute,
          e.g. <code>corresp="trans-raw.xml#raw.3 trans-raw.xml#raw.4"</code>.</p>
        </div>
        
      </div>

      <div xml:id="sec-metadata">
        <head>Corpus metadata</head>
        <p>TEI allows significant metadata to be added to a document.  The metadata is
        contained in the <gi>teiHeader</gi> element, which in corpora can appear at two
        levels:
        <list>
          <item>the overall corpus teiHeader, i.e. as part of the <gi>teiCorpus</gi> element;</item>
          <item>the teiHeader of individual corpus texts, i.e. as part of a <gi>TEI</gi> element.</item>
        </list>
        It is recommended that the metadata that is common to the whole corpus is stored in
        the corpus TEI header, whereas the text-specific metadata is in the corpus text TEI
        header.</p>
        
        <p>It is outside the scope of this specification to give all the details of a
        <gi>teiHeader</gi> element, for this, the user is referred to the Section on the <ref
        target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html">TEI header</ref>
        of the TEI Guidelines, and, of course, to the example corpora that are part of the
        Parla-CLARIN Git repository. Here we do, however, give some examples and concentrate on
        the metadata that is esp. relevant to parliamentary proceedings corpora.</p>

        <div xml:id="sec-vocabs">
          <head>Typologies</head>
          <p>Parla-CLARIN corpora can make many distinctions, such as types of
          governance or sessions, that can have controlled vocabularies.

          TEI supports encoding and referrencing of formalised <q>ontologies</q>
          further explained in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD55">Classification
          Declaration</ref> of the TEI Guidelines, by using the <gi>taxonomy</gi> element. To illusrate,
          we give below the start of a speaker-type taxonomy:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-taxo">
            <category xml:id="chair">

              <term>Regular</term>: a regular speaker at a meeting</catDesc>
            </category>
          </egXML>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div xml:id="sec-speakers">
          <head>Speaker metadata</head>
          <p>Unlike some other proposals, in particular Akoma Ntoso, the Parla-CLARIN recommendations
          assume that speaker meta-data is also included in the corpus,<note>Of course, this
          does not meant that links with corpus-external URIs are not allowed.</note> as
          this allows the corpus to be stand-alone with all the relevant data necessary for
          analysis already included in it.</p>
          
          <p>Information on speakers is given in the corpus TEI header, in particular in the
          <gi>listPerson</gi> element, itself a part of the participant description,
          i.e. the <gi>particDesc</gi> element.</p>

          <p>A <gi>listPerson</gi> typically contains <gi>person</gi> elements, which give
          information on an individual person, as the example below illustrates.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-speakers">
            <person xml:id="KučanMilan">
              <persName>
                <forename>Milan</forename>
                <surname>Kučan</surname>
              </persName>
              <sex value="M"/>
              <birth when="1941-01-14">
                <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3197229">Križevci</placeName>
              </birth>
            </person>
          </egXML>

          Each <gi>person</gi> must have an <att>xml:id</att> attribute, so that it can be referred
          to from the transcription. Apart from that, the only required element is
          <gi>persName</gi>, giving the name of the person. This can be contained directly in the
          element, or, as the preferred option, further decomposed into the person surname(s) and
          forename(s) or even other elements, as explained in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPER">Personal
          Names</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>

          <p>As illustrated above, further person metadata can contain the sex of the person and
          their birth date and place. Other potentially useful elements are the persons
          <gi>death</gi> date and place, as well as (possibly time stamped) <gi>education</gi>,
          <gi>occupation</gi>, and <gi>affiliation</gi>.</p>

          <p>In the context of PPCs, the <gi>affiliation</gi> element is especially important, as it
          can denote the person's membership in a political party or in the
	  parliament. Different types of affiliations are distinguished by the different
          values of the <att>role</att> attribute, such as <q>member</q>.
          As affiliations are not necessarily fixed, and the <gi>affiliation</gi> element can
          be marked for its temporal duration, as explained in the Section on
	  <ref target="#sec-temporal">Temporal information</ref>.
	  The example below illustrates the encoding of various affiliations.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-affiliation">
            <person xml:id="AnderličAnton">
              <persName>
                <surname>Anderlič</surname>
                <forename>Anton</forename>
              </persName>
              <affiliation role="member" ref="#party.ZSMS" from="1990-05-08" to="1990-11-09"/>
              <affiliation role="member" ref="#party.LDS.1" from="1990-11-10" to="1994-03-11"/>
              <affiliation role="member" ref="#DruzPolZb" from="1990-05-08" to="1992-12-22" ana="#SK.11"/>
              <affiliation role="member" ref="#DZ" from="1992-12-23" to="1996-11-27" ana="#DZ.1"/>
	    </person>
          </egXML>
	  </p>
	  
          <p>The example above uses, via the <att>ref</att> attribute, stand-off annotation to refer
          to the names of the parties, which should then be defined in a <gi>taxonomy</gi> element in
          the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, as explained in the Section on <ref target="#sec-party">Party
          metadata</ref>. The same can be done for the affiliation to the national assembly
	  (i.e. that the person is an MP),
          where, additionally, a reference, via the <att>ana</att> attribute, is given to the
          legislative period in which the person was an MP.</p>

	  <p>Alternatively (or additionally), the name of the party or national assembly can also be
	  given directly in the <gi>affiliation</gi> element using the <gi>orgName</gi> element, as
	  illustrated below. The example also illustrates the additional information, encoded as a
	  subordinate <gi>affiliation</gi> with the appropriate <att>role</att>, that the person was
	  elected as an MP to represent a certain constituency, giving its name and location.
	  
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-constituency">
            <affiliation role="member" ref="#DruzPolZb" from="1990-05-08" to="1996-11-27">

              <orgName xml:lang="en">National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia</orgName>
	      <affiliation role="consituency">
                <placeName ref="https://www.geonames.org/3194351">Novo mesto</placeName>
	      </affiliation>
	    </affiliation>
          </egXML>
          </p>

          <p>Persons can have further attributes, and TEI offers various elements (typically typed)
          to express them; they are introduced in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPERSEpc">Personal
          Characteristics</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. The two more general ones are <gi>state</gi>,
          which contains the description of some status or quality attributed to a person (or
          organisation), often at some specific time or for a specific date range and <gi>trait</gi>,
          which differs from <gi>state</gi> that it is independent of the volition or action of the
          holder and usually not at some specific time or for a specific date range. The former
          could, for example, be used to encode the fact that a PM was jailed for a given period of
          time, while the latter would e.g. be used for the information that a PM is handicapped.</p>

          <p>It is often advantageous to refer to external knowledge sources about a person, such as
          Wikipedia or VIAF. This is encoded using the <gi>idno</gi> element, whose content is
          typically a URI, while the <att>type</att> attribute denotes the kind of knowledge source
          referred to.

          As with persons, each organisation must contain an <att>xml:id</att> attribute, so
          that <gi>person</gi> elements can refer to it. The fact that the organisation is a
          political party is encoded in the <att>role</att> attribute, where the suggested
          values are defined in the Parla-CLARIN schema. The name(s) of the party are given in
          the <gi>orgName</gi> element, which also uses the <att>full</att> attribute to
          distinguish between the full name of the part and the initials of the party. Parties
          are also created and dissolved, and can also change their name.  The former is
          indicated by the <gi>event</gi> element, which, in the example above, we have typed
          as "existence" and where the dates of its existence are given in the <att>from</att>
          and <att>to</att> attributes. The same attributes on the <gi>orgName</gi> elements
          indicate the temporal duration of the parties names.<note>Note that there can exist a
          date where both names are valid names of the party - it is up to the processing
          software to make sense of this situation.</note></p>

        <div xml:id="sec-relation">
          <head>Relationships between people and parties</head>
          
          <p>It is also possible to encode relations between people and parties, e.g. kinship between
          MPs, or that one party is the successor of another one. For this purpose, TEI defines the
          <gi>listRelation</gi> element explained in detail in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPERSREL">Personal
          Relationships</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. This element can be contained by the
          <gi>listPerson</gi> or <gi>listOrg</gi> elements and, in turn, contains the
          <gi>relation</gi> elements, each of which defines one relation. The example below shows a
          relation between people.

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatpers">
            <relation name="parent" passive="#sbi243926" active="#sbi243926-0 #sbi243926-1"/>
          </egXML>

          The relation defines the relationship "parent" between the <att>active</att> persons of
          this relationship (i.e. those defined in the <gi>person</gi> element with the
          <att>xml:id</att> values of <val>sbi243926-0</val> and <val>sbi243926-1</val>) and the
          <att>passive</att> person of this relationship (i.e. the <gi>person</gi> element with the
          <att>xml:id</att> value of <val>sbi243926</val>).</p>

          <p>Relationships can also be mutual, e.g. in the case of spouses, as illustrated below
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatmutual">
            <relation name="spouse" mutual="#sbi243926 #sbi243929"/>
          </egXML>
          </p>

          <p>Relationship can also exist between parties (i.e. organisations), for example the
          fact that one party is a successor of another. This can be expressed as in the
          example below.

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-succparty">
            <relation name="successor" passive="#pp.SDZ" active="#pp.DS"/>
          </egXML>

          Another example is the set of parties that make up the coalition or opposition in
          a given time interval. As shown below, a coalition is also encoded as a
          <gi>relation</gi>, where the references to the parties comprising it are encoded
          in the <att>mutual</att> attribute. In contrast, the opposition <gi>relation</gi>
          distinguishes the <att>active</att> parties which comprise it, and the
          <att>passive</att> pointer to the definition of the government to which the
          parties are opposed:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatorg-simple">
            <listRelation>
              <relation name="coalition"
                        mutual="#party.S #party.F"
                        from="2013-05-23"
                        to="2017-01-10"/>
              <relation name="opposition"
                        active="#party.Vg #party.Bf #party.V #party.P #party.Sf"
                        passive="#GOV_LV"
                        from="2013-05-23"
                        to="2017-01-10"/>
            </listRelation>
          </egXML>

          If a coalition or opposition needs to have more information associated with it,
          e.g. its name, then a more complex encoding needs to be used, as illustrated
          below. Here all the information about the coalition (i.e. an <gi>org</gi> of
          <att>type</att> coalition) is encoded in a <gi>listOrg</gi> element, which then
          defines the name of the coalition, followed by its <gi>listRelation</gi>, as
          before.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-relatorg-complex">
            <listOrg>

      <div xml:id="sec-transcript">
        <head>Transcriptions</head>
        
        <p>The transcriptions of the parliamentary debates are the central part of these
        recommendations and this section explains how to encode the transcriptions of
        speeches proper, and how to treat the commentary inserted by the
        transcribers, which often marks various verbal and non-verbal incidents, such
        as applause, interruption of speeches, voting (with results) etc.  Most of
        these elements are explained in the Chapter on <ref
        target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TS.html">Transcription
        of Speech</ref> of the TEI Guidelines, and we illustrate the essential ones
        below.</p>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-uterrance">
          <head>Utterances</head>
          <p>A speech is marked up using the <gi>u</gi> (utterance) element, as illustrated below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-speech">
            <u who="#DavidPrior" ana="#regular">
              <seg>I ask that the draft Regulations laid before the House on 5 December be approved.</seg>
              <seg>The relevant document is the 20th Report from the Legislation Committee.</seg>
            </u>
          </egXML>
          
          The main attribute of an utterance is <att>who</att>, which gives the pointer to the
          <gi>person</gi> element containing the metadata of the speaker. The <gi>u</gi>
          element can also have the <att>ana</att> attribute giving one or more pointers to a
          typology of types of speakers. In our case, it would point to a category that
          specifies that the speaker is a regular speaker (rather than, e.g., the chair) of the
          session.</p>
          
          <p>The utterances can (but are not required to) be segmented using the generic
          TEI element for segments, <gi>seg</gi>, which encodes the paragraphs of the source
          transcription.<note>The reason why the TEI element for paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) is not
          used is that utterances, being essentially (transcriptions of) spoken text, do not
          allow for internal paragraphs, a concept pertinent more to written text.</note></p>
        </div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-comments">
          <head>Transcriber comments</head>
          
          <p>Transcriber comments encode information such as interruptions, notes on
          what is happening in the chamber, results of voting, etc.
          Note that while section headings can also be taken as a kind of transcriber comments, these
          serve to structure a document, and are therefore treated in the Section on
          <ref target="#sec-textstruct">Text divisions</ref>.</p>

          <p>In general, transcriber comments are encoded using <gi>note</gi>, although some
          comments can be encoded using more precise TEI elements, as explained below.  Whether
          <gi>note</gi> or these more specific elements will be used, and, indeed, whether
          comments are preserved in the encoding at all, will depend on the needs and resources
          of each particular project.</p>

          <p>The example below lists some typically transcriber comments, which are here further
          qualified by their <att>type</att> attribute:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-notes">
            <note type="speaker">The president, Dr. Milan Brglez:</note>
            <note type="time">The sesssion began at 10 o'clock.</note>
            <note type="vote-ayes">84 voted for the adotion of the measure.</note>
            <note type="vote-noes">2 voted against the adotion of the measure.</note>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>The first note simply gives the speaker of the utterance that would follow it, the
          second one gives the time when the session started, while the third and fourth are
          notes on the voting results. Note that in all three cases, instead of, or in addition
          to retaining such notes, the information contained in them can also be further
          explicated in dedicated markup. So, the information given in the first note will
          typically be encoded in the <att>who</att> attribute, the second could be
          encoded in the <code>u/@when</code> attribute, while how to encode the last two is
          explained in the Section on <ref target="sec-voting">Voting results</ref>.  It is
          therefore a matter of editorial policy whether to faithfully reproduce the
          transcription, including comments, or whether to remove the comments when they have
          already been taken into account when processing the transcriptions.</p>

          <p>Some types of transcriber comments can also be encoded using more specific TEI
          elements than <gi>note</gi>.
          In particular, the TEI module for Transcription of Speech (<q><ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TS.html#TSBA">Elements
          unique to spoken texts</ref></q>) defines the following <q>incident</q>
          elements that correspond to various types of transcriber's comments:
          <list>
            <item><gi>vocal</gi> marks any vocalized but not necessarily lexical phenomenon,
            e.g. laughter, sounds of (dis)agreement from the benches etc.</item>
            <item><gi>kinesic</gi> marks any communicative phenomenon, not necessarily
            vocalized, for example clapping, a gesture or frown, etc.</item>
            <item><gi>incident</gi> marks any phenomenon or occurrence, not necessarily
            vocalized or communicative, for example incidental noises or other events
            affecting communication.</item>
          </list>
          
          The example below illustrates the use of these three elements:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-incidents">
            <u xml:lang="sl" who="#SDZ5.AhačičMonika">With this I disolve the parliament!</u>
            <vocal who="#opposition"><desc xml:lang="en">shouting</desc></vocal>
            <kinesic who="#SDZ5.AhačičMonika"><desc xml:lang="en">banging the gavel</desc></kinesic>
            <incident><desc xml:lang="en">army storms the parliament</desc></incident>
            <kinesic who="#governmet"><desc xml:lang="en">clapping</desc></kinesic>
          </egXML>
          
	  As the example shows, the content of the transcriber comment is retained in the
	  <gi>desc</gi> element, while the <att>who</att> attribute can be used to specify who
	  is responsible for the incident. All three elements can also be further qualified using their
          <att>type</att> and <att>subtype</att> attributes.
          </p>

          <p>It should be noted that <gi>note</gi> and the four <q>incident</q> elements
          can be placed either on the same level as the <gi>u</gi> elements, or directly
          inside them (so, on the same level as <gi>seg</gi> elements) or even inside
          <gi>seg</gi> elements. It is recommended to place them as far up the hierarchy as
          possible, and especially avoid having them inside elements with otherwise contain
          text only (i.e. utterances or segments), as placing elements there leads to mixed
          content, which is difficult to process further, in particular if the text is to
          be linguistically annotated. However, if a transcriber comment is placed in the
          middle of the text, then it needs to be encoded inside the utterance, except if
          the utterance is split, as is further explained in the Section on <ref
          target="#sec-interruptions">Interrupted utterances</ref>.</p>
        </div>

        <div xml:id="sec-gaps">
          <head>Gaps</head>

	  <p>The transcribers can also comment that a part of the speech was not
	  transcribed, e.g. because the recording was not understood, sometimes also noting
	  the reason why, such as that the microphone was not turned on, that there was
	  noise in the chamber, or that the speaker was speaking too quietly. These notes
	  can be encoded as the <gi>gap</gi> element, which is then also marked by
	  <att>reason</att>=<val>inaudible</val>.  The original transcriber note can be
	  left in the <gi>desc</gi> element, as illustrated below.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-gap">
	    ... I would further state that
	    <gap reason="inaudible">
	      <desc>Microphone off</desc>
	    </gap>
	    and furthermore ....
          </egXML>
	  </p>

	  <p>The other reason for omitting a part of the transcription can be an editorial
	  decision of the corpus compilers. The transcript can, for example, contain
	  material that they do not want to include in the corpus, such as tables, or
	  parts of the transcription that cannot be converted to text. In these cases, the
	  reason given should be "editorial", while the <gi>desc</gi> should contain what
	  has been omitted, as illustrated below.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-gap-editorial">
            <gap reason="editorial">
              <desc xml:lang="en">Table omitted</desc>
            </gap>
          </egXML>
	  </p>

	</div>
	
        <div xml:id="sec-interruptions">
          <head>Interrupted utterances</head>
          <p>A special case occurs when a transcription note states that somebody interrupted
          the speaker and gives the transcript of the interruption, with the main speaker
          then continuing with their speech, as in the following snippet:
          
          <eg>Boris Johnson: I propose a no-deal Brexit. /Jeremy Corbyn: Traitor!/ Because 
          England does not want any dealings with the European Union.</eg>
          
          While the interruption might be simply encoded as a <gi>note</gi> or
          <gi>vocal</gi> element, as explained above, it is more precisely encoded as a
          separate utterance, which brings with it the problem that nested utterances are
          not allowed, so the main utterance then needs to be split into two (or more)
          pieces. The example below illustrates how this is encoded:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-splitu">
            <u who="#BorisJohnson" xml:id="GB001.8.3" next="#GB001.8.5">I propose a no-deal Brexit.</u>
            <u who="#JeremyCorbyn" xml:id="GB001.8.4">Traitor!</u>
            <u who="#BorisJohnson" xml:id="GB001.8.5" prev="#GB001.8.3">Because England does not want any dealings with the European Union.</u>
          </egXML>
          
          As can be seen, the split is indicated by the use of the <att>next</att>
          attribute on the first part of the split utterance and by the <att>prev</att>
          attribute of the next part of the split utterance. The values of the attributes
          are pointers to the next of previous identifiers of the appropriate part of the
          split utterance.<note>Note that, in general, the utterance can also be split in
          the middle of a sentence, which brings with it problems for automatic linguistic
          processing, as, ideally, the parts should be first joined, and only then
          processed.</note></p>
        </div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-qa">
          <head>Addressees, questions and answers</head>
	  <p>Sometimes particular speeches are in fact questions (or statements) addressed to a
	  person, or answers to particular questions, again, directed at the person that posed the
	  question, and it might be advantageous to encode this fact. The encoding of a question and
	  answer, and to whom it is directed is illustrated below.
	  
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-qa">
            <u xml:id="q_1" who="#kappa" toWhom="#eta" ana="#question">

            </u>
            <u xml:id="a_1" who="#eta" toWhom="#kappa" ana="#answer">
              <seg>Mr. Kappa, BNAT was the only umbrella professional body for ...</seg>
            </u>
          </egXML>
	  
	  The person at whom a speech is directed is encoded in the <att>toWhom</att> attribute on
	  the <gi>u</gi> element, which is, same as <att>who</att>, a reference which must point to a
	  defined person. For the fact that the first speech is a question, and the second an
	  answer, we here presuppose a taxonomy in the <gi>teiHeader</gi> of the corpus, which
	  defines the types of utterances we wish to distinguish, and the <val>question</val> and
	  <val>answer</val> are IDs of the appropriate categories.
          </p>
	</div>
	
        <div xml:id="sec-voting">
          <head>Voting results</head>
          <p>One further aspects of the transcripts, which can be of particular interest for
          some researchers, needs to be mentioned, namely voting results. Voting results are
          typically mentioned in the transcripts as a note, and we follow Akoma Ntoso in its
          treatment. Assuming a <gi>taxonomy</gi> in the TEI header that defines "ayes" and
          "noes", the note can be marked up using the <gi>measure</gi> element, as the
          following example shows:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-voting1">

        <head>Linguistic annotation</head>
        <p>This section introduces basic types of linguistic annotation that can be added
        to PPCs; the examples should be sufficient for users to be able to add further types
        of linguistic annotation to PPC corpora.</p>
        
        <p>It is recommended that linguistically annotated PPCs are stored in two
        versions, one with the linguistic annotations, and the other without
        them. The reason for this is that many users prefer to use the
        <q>plain-text</q> version, e.g. because they want to perform their own
        linguistic annotation, or this kind of annotation is simply not relevant for
        their research questions.</p>
        
        <p>The TEI Guidelines discuss basic linguistic annotation in their Chapter on <ref
        target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html">Simple Analytic
        Mechanisms</ref> and we follow one particular option given there. In particular, it is
        recommended that (where possible) the annotation is in-line (as opposed to stand-off),
        i.e. that the linguistic annotation is given in the main document, and therefore mixed
        with the other annotations, rather than in a separate document with pointers into the
        base text.</p>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-anawords">
          <head>Basic word-level annotation</head>
          
          <p>Basic linguistic annotation comprises sentence segmentation, tokenisation,
          part-of-speech tagging and lemmatisation. The Parla-CLARIN recommendations
          specialise the recommendations given in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html#AILALW">Lightweight
          Linguistic Annotation</ref> of the TEI Guidelines. The following example shows the
          basic principles of the annotation:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-ud">

            </s>
          </egXML>
          
          Sentences are marked up using the <gi>s</gi> element, words with the <gi>w</gi>
          element and punctuation symbols with the <gi>pc</gi> element. To retain the
          linguistically significant whitespace, the <att>join</att> element is used, with the
          possible values being <val>no</val> (assumed to be the default), <val>right</val>
          (no whitespace to the right of the token) and <val>left</val> (no whitespace to the
          left of the token) and <val>both</val> (no whitespace to either side of the
          token). While, in the preceding example, it would be more intuitive to have the
          value <val>left</val> marked on the full-stop, we recommend that only the value
          <val>right</val> is used on the preceding token, as this simplifies processing.</p>
          
          <p>The base form of a word is given in the <att>lemma</att> attribute,<note>Note
          that punctuation characters, <gi>pc</gi>, do not have a <att>lemma</att> attribute,
          as they cannot sensibly be said to have lemmas.</note> while the situation with the
          part-of-speech tags is somewhat more complicated. For analytic tagsets, where a
          "part-of-speech tag" is actually a set of attribute-values, as in the example above,
          the <att>msd</att> attribute should be used. For synthetic tagsets, such as the <ref
          target="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html">Penn
          Treebank tagset</ref>, which have atomic tags that cannot always be decomposed into
          attribute-value pairs (e.g. "TO" for the word "to"), a better alternative is to use
          of the <att>pos</att> attribute.</p>

	  <p>There is also a third option, for tags that are look like strings, however, they
	  are meant as a shorthand for a feature-structure representation, as is the case with
	  the <ref target="http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/html/">MULTEXT-East tagset</ref>. For
	  these, it is best to use the generic <att>ana</att> attribute, whose value is a
	  pointer, as shown in the following example:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-msd">
            <s>
              <w ana="#Pd-nsg" lemma="ta">Tega</w>
              <w ana="#Px------y" lemma="se">se</w>
              <w ana="#Q" lemma="sploh">sploh</w>
              <w ana="#Va-r1s-y" lemma="biti">nisem</w>
              <w ana="#Vmep-sm" lemma="zavesti" join="right">zavedel</w>
              <pc ana="#Z">.</pc>
            </s>
          </egXML>
          
          Here, the tags are pointers to identifiers, where the elements bearing these
          identifiers define the appropriate feature-structures, i.e. pairs of
          attribute-values, as in the example below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-fs">
            <fs xml:id="Pd-nsg" xml:lang="en">
              <f name="CATEGORY"><symbol value="Pronoun"/></f>
              <f name="Type"><symbol value="demonstrative"/></f>
              <f name="Gender"><symbol value="neuter"/></f>
              <f name="Number"><symbol value="singular"/></f>
              <f name="Case"><symbol value="genitive"/></f>
            </fs>
          </egXML>
          </p>

	  <p>Such feature structures are grouped together in the feature-value library
	  (<gi>fvLib</gi>) element, which can be contained in its own <gi>TEI</gi> element of
	  the corpus. As <att>ana</att> is a pointer, it can also contain complete URLs
	  (e.g. <code>http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/tables/msd-fslib2-sl.xml#Pd-nsg</code>) which
	  enables the feature-structure definitions to be stored externaly to the
	  corpus. However, prefixing such PoS tags for each token by the complete URL would
	  lead to very large files. This is why the TEI offers a mechanism to shorten 
	  references to URLs. This mechanism is explained in the Section <ref
	  target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.html#SAPU">Using
	  Abbreviated Pointers</ref> of the TEI Guidelines, and we give below and example:
	  
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-prefix">
            <s>
              <w ana="mte:Pd-nsg" lemma="ta">Tega</w>
              <w ana="mte:Px------y" lemma="se">se</w>
              <w ana="mte:Q" lemma="sploh">sploh</w>
              <w ana="mte:Va-r1s-y" lemma="biti">nisem</w>
              <w ana="mte:Vmep-sm" lemma="zavesti" join="right">zavedel</w>
              <pc ana="mte:Z">.</pc>
            </s>
          </egXML>
	  
	  As can be seen, the only difference to the preceding example is that the values (IDs) of
	  the tags are preceded by <code>mte:</code> rather than <code>#</code>. This prefix should
	  be then expanded by the processing software to whatever the <gi>prefixDef</gi> element,
	  defined in the TEI header, specifies, as shown in the example below:
	  
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-prefixDef">
            <prefixDef ident="mte"

          <head>Normalised and syntactic words</head>
          
          <p>In certain contexts a word (or, in general, a token) in the transcription needs to be
          normalised in a certain way. In the context of PPCs, this can happen with historical
          transcripts, which contain archaic wordforms and where we wish to annotate them with
          their modernised forms, or when the transcript is linguistically annotated, and the
          annotation framework distinguishes original words form syntactic words (i.e. has the
          concept of <q>multiwords</q>), as is the case in the <ref
          target="https://universaldependencies.org/format.html#words-tokens-and-empty-nodes">Universal
          Dependencies framework</ref>.</p>
	  
	  <p>For simple normalisation, where a one-word token is normalised into another word token,
	  the <att>norm</att> attribute on word or punctuation tokens should be used, as explained
	  at the end of the Section <ref
	  target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html#AILALW">Lightweight
	  Linguistic Annotation</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>

	  <p>More challenging is the case where one original word token must be represented as
	  several normalised words, either in the context of historical corpora or, as mentioned
	  above, in the context of multiword units. For this, we use embedded empty words with
	  associated <att>norm</att> attributes, and possibly other attributes with linguistic
	  annotation. For example, Czech has the word <q>abyste</q> which is decomposed into two
	  syntactic words, <q>aby</q> and <q>byste</q>. This should be encoded as in the following
	  example:<note>Note that the example is rendered in three lines, however, the correct
	  encoding in the corpus is actually in a single line, without any spaces between the
	  elements, as otherwise the new line and indenting spaces are actually a part of the word
	  <q>abyste</q>.</note>

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-1-2">
	    <w>abyste
            <w norm="aby" lemma="aby"/>
            <w norm="byste" lemma="být"/>
            </w>
          </egXML>
	  </p>
	  
          <p>There are also cases where two (or more) original words correspond to one normalised
          word. Here, it is the outer word that carries the <att>norm</att> and possibly other
          linguistic attributes, while the inner words are the original ones. For example, Slovene
          used to form the superlative form of adjectives with the word <q>naj</q> written
          separately (and often as <q>nar</q>), while in contemporary Slovene the <q>naj</q> is a
          prefix of the adjective. This case should be encoded as follows:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-2-1">
	    <w norm="najlepši" lemma="lep"><w>nar</w> <w>lepši</w></w>

          <head>Segmental annotation</head>
          
          <p>A common annotation type, used e.g. for marking named entities or terms, is
          segmental annotation, where a stretch of text or tokens is simply enclosed in XML
          tags, as the following example illustrates:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-names">

          TEI offers a number of elements that can be used for such annotations,

          In the example, each token, as well as the sentence element are given an ID, and the
          first link group specifies the Universal Dependencies syntactic analysis of the
          sentence, while the second one gives its semantic role labels.  They are distinguished
          by their <att>type</att> attribute<note>We do not specify the values of
          <att>type</att> of the link group as the range of possibilities is too great and not
          known in advance.</note>, while the <att>targFunc</att> attribute explains the
          functions of the references given in the <att>target</att> attributes of the contained
          <gi>link</gi> elements.</p>
          
          <p>The contained links then give the references to the head and argument tokens of
          the relation, while the <att>ana</att> attribute specifies what kind of a relation
          this is. It should be noted that the value of the analysis attribute is a pointer,
          and, in the example, we use the TEI prefix mechanism, which is then expanded via the
          <gi>prefixDef</gi> element in the TEI header to resolve into a URI pointer (as
          explained in Section on <ref target="#sec-idents">Identifiers and referencing</ref>),
          most likely to pointing to <gi>taxonomy</gi> categories that give the definitions of
          the relations. A further point to notice is that the sentence serves as the Root
          element of the sentence, i.e. the fifth link of the UD analysis ties together the
          sentence with the top-most token of the sentence.</p>

        <p>Parliamentary corpora can also have data from other modalities associated with the
        transcripts, in particular audio or video recordings, and the facsimile of the original
        transcripts, particularly relevant for older parliamentary proceedings. This section
        explains how to encode such data in the TEI encoded documents, where it is assumed that
        the actual speech, video and images are stored in separate files, and the TEI document
        makes reference to them.</p>

          <p>The transcription can refer to and align with external audio and video data using
          the <gi>timeline</gi> element, explained in the Section on <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.html#SASYMP">Placing
          Synchronous Events in Time</ref> of the TEI Guidelines, and further elaborated in

          resource management -- Transcription of spoken language</ref>. While the ISO standard
          is better elaborated, it also changes and adds element definitions, so we are using
          the standard TEI variant of speech encoding as far as the schema is concerned, while
          taking into account, as much as possible, specific encoding choices as proposed by
          the ISO standard.</p>
          
          <p>First, TEI offers the <gi>recordingStmt</gi> element (a part of <gi>fileDesc</gi>
          of the TEI header) which contains the information about the recording(s) of the
          transcription. This information can be unstructured (i.e. a series of <gi>ab</gi>
          elements) or structured (contained in the <gi>recording</gi> element); Parla-CLARIN
          recommends the structured version. As shown in the example below, the element
          contains information of the type of recording (audio / video), its duration<note>The
          <att>dur</att> values should follow the <ref
          target="https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/#duration">W3C

          (<gi>respStmt</gi>) of the person or agency that made the recording, the date when
          the recording file was made and the equipment used:

          </p>
          
          <p>The mapping of time intervals of the recording to IDs in the TEI document is
          encoded in the <gi>timeline</gi> element, in particular in the contained
          <gi>when</gi> elements. As explained below, these IDs are then used to link elements
          in the transcription to the timeline, therefore each <gi>when</gi> element must have
          the <att>xml:id</att> attribute. The <gi>when</gi> elements must also be in the same
          order as the time-points they encode.</p>
          
          <p>As the example below shows, the timeline gives the unit in which the intervals are
          specified (typically second, <code>s</code>) and the time origin of the timeline,
          here referring to the first <gi>when</gi> element, at the very start of the
          recording, so specified with the absolute time.  Further <gi>when</gi> elements give
          the interval between this origin point and their end:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-timeline">
            <timeline unit="s" origin="#T0">
              <when xml:id="T0" absolute="00:00:00.0"/>
              <when xml:id="T1" interval="1.13" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T2" interval="3.84" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T3" interval="5.33" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T4" interval="9.35" since="#T0"/>
              <when xml:id="T5" interval="12.62" since="#T0"/>
            </timeline>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>The IDs of the timeline synchronisation are then used by the <gi>u</gi>
	  elements in the transcription via their <att>start</att> and
          <att>end</att> attributes. In the examples below we give three cases of such linking:
          the first one gives a straightforward temporal structure on the <gi>u</gi>;
	  the second one uses the
          empty <gi>anchor</gi> element to give additional temporal structure for cases where
          the synchronised parts of the utterance are not further marked-up
	  (or the synchronisation is required for elements that don't have the <att>start</att> and
          <att>end</att> attributes); while the third and
          fourth demonstrate the case where two utterances are partially overlapping:<note>Note
          that in such cases we would also use the <att>prev</att> and <att>next</att>
          attributes, as shown in the <ref target="#exa-splitu">Example on split
          utterances</ref>.</note>:

          <head>Facsimile</head>
          <p>In cases where the facsimile of the original transcription is available
          (especially valuable for older parliamentary proceedings, where the exact
          appearance of the original proceedings is of interest), it is advantageous to
          enable viewing the original together with the encoded transcription. How to
          achieve this, in general, is explained in the <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html">Chapter on
          Representation of Primary Sources</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>
          
          <p>The simplest but also the most limiting way to achieve this is to have per-page
          facsimile files and use the page break i.e. <gi>pb</gi> element to mark page
          boundaries in the transcript and then directly specify the image file of the page
          with the <att>facs</att> attribute, as illustrated in the example below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-pb">
            <body>
              <pb facs="PNG/page1.png"/>
              <!-- text contained on page 1 encoded here -->
              <pb facs="PNG/page2.png"/>
              <!-- text contained on page 2 encoded here -->
            </body>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>By convention, this encoding indicates that the image indicated by the
          <att>facs</att> attribute represents the whole of the text following the
          <gi>pb</gi> element, up to the next <gi>pb</gi> element. The page break element
          can also contain a reference to the source HTML of web-harvested proceeding using
          the <att>source</att> attribute, and per-page links to audio or vidoe (cf.  the
          Section on <ref target="#sec-speechvideo">Speech and video</ref>), as illustrated
          in the following example:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-pb-source">
            <pb n="1"
                source="https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2013ps/stenprot/044schuz/s044051.htm"
                xml:id="ParlaMint-CZ_2016-04-13-ps2013-044-02-006-162.pb1"
                corresp="#ps2013-044-02-006-162.audio1"/>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>A more complicated solution to referring to facsimiles, where it is possible
          to have several images per page (e.g. in different resolutions) or to specify
          areas of a page is enabled by the <gi>facsimile</gi> element, which should appear
          immediately before the <gi>text</gi> element of a TEI document. The example below
          refers to the first and third pages directly with the <gi>graphic</gi> element,
          whereas the second page is encoded as a <gi>surface</gi> which then contains the
          page image in two resolutions:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-facsimile">
            <facsimile>
              <graphic xml:id="page1" url="PNG/page1.png"/>
              <surface xml:id="page2">
                <graphic type="600dpi" url="PNG/page2-highRes.png"/>
                <graphic type="300dpi" url="PNG/page2-lowRes.png"/>
              </surface>
              <graphic xml:id="page3" url="PNG/page3.png"/>
            </facsimile>
          </egXML>
          
          Such definitions are then referred to via local references in <att>facs</att> attribute of
          <gi>pb</gi>, as discussed previosly.</p>
          
          <p>More complicated cases, such as delimiting portions of a page are also supported
          by the TEI Guidelines, and for these the reader is referred directly to the Section
          on <ref

        <p>A TEI encoded document is, in general, not meant to be used directly by software
        programs, rather it serves as an interchange and storage format.  Furthermore, most TEI
        documents are not "born TEI", but rather converted into TEI from some source format.
        In this section we discuss some up- and down-conversion scripts that have already been
        developed for transforming source formats into Parla-CLARIN and from Parla-CLARIN into
        formats immediately usable by software and are available in the Git repository of
        Parla-CLARIN.</p>

          <head>Conversion from Akoma Ntoso</head>
          <p>As mentioned in the Section on <ref target="#sec-akoma">Introducing Akoma
          Ntoso</ref>, this standard is used to encode parliamentary proceedings of several
          countries, and this section introduces the developed conversion of AKN documents to
          Parla-CLARIN. The example documents and conversion script can be found in the
          <code>Examples/AkomaNtoso</code> folder of the Parla-CLARIN Git repository. For a
          detailed treatment of the conversion, the XSLT script <code>akn2tei.xsl</code> should
          be consulted, while we here mention only some of the more aspects of the
          conversion.</p>

          <p>First, and on a minor point, the conversion to TEI attempts to preserve the IDs of
          the source AKN document, however, Akoma Ntoso distinguishes three ID-bearing
          attributes, namely <att>eId</att> (expression identifier), <att>wId</att> (work
          identifier) and <att>GUID</att> (globally unique identifier). The first is simply
          mapped to the <att>xml:id</att> attribute of the TEI document, while the latter two
          are given in the <gi>publicationStmt</gi> of the TEI header and in the 
          <gi>idno</gi> element, as the following example illustrates:

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-id">
            <idno type="wId" corresp="#section_2_1">section_2_2</idno>

            Some of these elements are mapped to specific TEI elements or attributes, e.g. the
            language of the text specified in the <gi>FRBRExpression</gi> maps to the
            <att>xml:lang</att> of the <gi>TEI</gi> element, but this does not hold for all the
            FRBR information, which we also wanted to retain in the TEI document.</p>
            
            <p>To convert all FRBR information to TEI, we used the recommendations of <ref

            Libraries</ref>, in particular as given the Section on <ref

            it is recommended that FRBR information is encoded in the <gi>sourceDesc</gi>
            element of the TEI header as a <gi>listRelation</gi>. As opposed to the original
            AKN <gi>identification</gi> the <gi>listRelation</gi> contains a simple list of
            <gi>relation</gi> elements, so these must also specify the relation between the
            particular piece of data and the fact that it belongs to the FRBR <q>work</q>,
            <q>expression</q>, or <q>manifestation</q>. These and other formalised relations

            There are few points to notice in this conversion:
            <list>
              <item>Where AKN qualifies its FRBR statements with the additional <att>name</att>
              attribute, which does not have a controlled vocabulary, its value is retained in
              the <att>name</att> attribute of the TEI <gi>relation</gi>.</item>

              <item>The conversion also specifies the formal equivalence (OWL
              <code>sameAs</code>) of the official FRBR definition of <q>work</q>,
              <q>expression</q>, and <q>manifestation</q> (so, <ref
              target="http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/">http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/</ref>) with the
              AKN recommended ontology of these terms, namely <ref
              target="https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot">https://w3id.org/akn/ontology/allot/</ref>.</item>
            </list>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div xml:id="sec-convakn-qa">
          <head>Converting addressee, role, questions and answers</head>
          <p>Akoma Ntoso can directly specify not only the speaker of an utterance (as the
          value of the <att>by</att> attribute) but also the role of the speaker for a
          particular utterance (<att>as</att> attribute) and to whom the speech is addressed
          to (<att>to</att> attribute), as exemplified below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-to">
            <speech by="#khalwale" to="#speaker" as="#pm">
              <p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give notice of the following Motion:-</p>
              ...
            </speech>
          </egXML>

	  TEI has the attribute <att>toWhom</att>, which directly corresponds to the <att>to</att>
	  attribute. TEI, however, does not have an attribute that would correspond to the AKN
	  <att>as</att>, so this is encoded as the value of the general <att>ana</att> attribute,
	  which should point to the appropriate <gi>category</gi> of the pertinent taxonomy for
	  defining the roles of the speakers. The Parla-CLARIN encoding is thus:

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-totei">
            <u who="#khalwale" ana="#pm" toWhom="#speaker">
              <seg>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to give notice of the following Motion:-</seg>
              ...
            </u>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>A similar problem, and its solution, concerns the distinction made in Akoma
          Ntoso between questions and answers, each of which has in AKN a dedicated element,
          as shown in the following example:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-qa">
            <question eId="question_1" by="#kappa" to="#ministerEducation">
              <p>I would like to ask the Minister for Education about ...</p>
            </question>
            <answer eId="answer_1" by="#eta" as="#ministerEducation">
              <p>Mr. Speaker, BNAT was the only umbrella professional body for...</p>
            </answer>
          </egXML>

          In the conversion to TEI we note that someting is a question or answer (or, in fact, any
          other type of utterance) by assuming a taxonomy specifying the categories corresponding
          to the types of speeches that we wish to distinguish, and the <val>question</val> and
          <val>answer</val> are IDs of the appropriate categories. We can then refer to these
          categories in the <att>ana</att> attribute of the utterance. Furthermore, and in case we
          wish to direclty link the question and answer, we can use for this the <gi>relation</gi>
          element using its <att>name</att> with the value <code>questionAnswer</code>. Such
          <gi>listRelation</gi> can be placed in an arbitrary portion of the document, as it
          contains links to IDs, but is, by convention, best placed inside the answer. We exemplify
          the Parla-CLARIN encoding of a question and answer below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-akn-qa-tei">
            <u xml:id="question_1" who="#kappa" toWhom="#ministerEducation" ana="#question">
              <seg>I would like to ask the Minister for Education about ...</seg>
            </u>
            <u xml:id="answer_1" who="#eta" ana="#ministerEducation #answer" toWhom="#kappa">
              <seg>Mr. Speaker, BNAT was the only umbrella professional body for ...</seg>
	      <listRelation>
                <relation name="questionAnswer" active="#question_1" passive="#answer_1"/>
	      </listRelation>

        <head>Conversion to RDF</head>
        <p>As explained in the Section on <ref target="#sec-rdf">Introducing
        RDF</ref>, this data model would be a useful <q>down-conversion</q> of
        Parla-CLARIN corpora.</p>
        
        <p>On the tei-l mailing list there have already been discussions on how to
        link TEI with RDF, summarised and with further links in <ref
        target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1860">Issue #1860</ref> of the
        <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/">TEI GitHub project</ref>.
        The best way seems to be to either directly turn TEI markup into RDF triples,
        or, where this is not possible, to use the RDFa attribute on TEI elements.</p>

        <p>An implementation might be best approached from the opposite direction,
        i.e. developing an <q>up-conversion</q> to TEI of an existing RDF-encoded
        CPP.</p>
