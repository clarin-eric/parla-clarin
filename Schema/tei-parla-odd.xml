        <head>Introduction</head>
	<p>Corpora of parliamentary proceedings are a quintessential
	resource for a wide range of research questions from a number
	of SSH disciplines, such as critical discourse analysis,
	history, as well as Sociolinguistics. Their most
	distinguishing characteristic is that they are transcriptions
	of spoken language produced in controlled and regulated
	circumstances. For this reason, they are rich in invaluable
	(sociodemographic) metadata as well as easily available under
	the Freedom of Information Acts set in place to enable
	informed participation by the public and to improve effective
	functioning of democratic systems, making the datasets even
	more valuable.</p>
	<p>Given these reasons and the fact that parliamentary proceedings are more and more
	often avaliable on-line, many researchers have already compiled corpora of
	parliamentary proceedings.</p>

	<div>
          <head>Characters</head>

	  <p>A Parla-CLARIN corpus should, in general, capture as much
	  of the text and markup from the source as possble, while the
	  presence of graphical items or other elements that could not
	  or were not transcribed should be indicated by markup, in
	  particular with the use of <gi>gap</gi>.</p>
	  
	  <p>The corpus should be encoded in Unicode, using the UTF-8
	  character encoding, at least for European languages.  In cases
	  where the original contains characters from the Unicode
	  Private Use Area, these should be either given their closest
	  equivalents, or, preferably, be appropriatelly marked up by
	  the use of the <gi>g</gi> element.</p>
	  
	  <p>End-of-line hyphens can be removed, and the split words
	  joined in order to simplify linguistic processing.</p>
	  
	  <p>Two characters, esp. prevalent when the source documents
	  are in Word, deserve special mention:</p>
	  
	  <list>
	    <item>Non-breaking pace (U+00A0), which prevents, with some
	    applications, collapsing consecutive white space characters
	    into a single space. As TEI-Parla is not interested in
	    preserving the details of the layout, it is recommended that
	    this character is substituted by the regular space
	    (U+0020).</item>
	    <item>Soft hyphen (U+00AD), which indicates that a word can
	    be hyphenated at that point. These characters should be
	    removed from the corpus, as they only complicate further
	    processing.
	    </item>
	  </list>

	  <p>While not required, it is sensible to also normalise
	  sequences of whitespace characters (such as tabulators,
	  end-of-line characters and spaces) into a single space or
	  end-of-line character. Again, this simplifies further
	  (esp. linguistic) processing.</p>
	 
	</div>

	<div>
          <head>Documenting the encoding process</head>

	  <p>Difficult encoding situations that are not covered by the
	  TEI Guidelines should be documented in the
	  <gi>editorialDecl</gi> of the corpus TEI header.

	  In particular, if the source texts has been changed (so,
	  ommitting or normalising figures, text, EOL hyphens, special
	  characters, etc. as discussed above) this practice should be
	  documented in the <gi>correction</gi> and
	  <gi>normalization</gi> elements of the editorial
	  declaration.</p>
	  
	</div>

	<head>Files</head>

      <div>
	<p>While this proposal makes the assumption that a complete
	corpus is one TEI document, this does not mean that it
	should also be stored in one file, as the file structure is
	distinct from the concept of XML documents. To enable one XML document to
	be composed of several files, the XInclude recommendation should be used</p>
      </div>

        <head>Overall document structure</head>

	<div>
          <head>Corpus structure</head>
	  
	  <p>As illustrated below, a CLARIN-Parla corpus is rooted in
	  an <gi>teiCorpus</gi> element, which should also contain the
	  <att>xml:lang</att> attribute with the appropriate language
	  code<note>For multilingual document, this code would be
	  <q>mul</q> for <q>multiple languages</q></note>. The
	  <gi>teiHeader</gi> of the corpus then contains the metadata
	  for the complete corpus, including the metadata that is
	  referred to by the subordinate <gi>TEI</gi> elements, such
	  as the defined taxonomies and the list of speakers.</p>
	  
	  <p>We do not specify what an individual <gi>TEI</gi> element should contain, as the
	  size and granularity of parliamentary debate corpora, not to mention the national rules
	  of structuring the workings of the parliament will differ substantially. Typically, however,
	  and individual <gi>TEI</gi> element would contain one sitting or session or one day, in any case
	  such data that has common metadata that distinguishes it from the other
	  <gi>TEI</gi> elements in the corpus.</p>

	  <p>Finally, although not given in the Figure below, a
	  <gi>text</gi> element can contain, apart from the
	  <gi>body</gi> also a <gi>front</gi> element before it and/or
	  a <gi>back</gi> element after it. While the <gi>body</gi>
	  will contain the speeches and is obligatory, the former
	  could contain some preamble text, while the latter various
	  appendices or texts that are related to the speeches.</p>

          <head>Text divisions</head>

	  <p>In the text body, as well as in the front and back matter, the element that further
	  organises their content is the division, <gi>div</gi>, and each of the three elements (if present)
	  should contain at least one division.</p>

	  <p>The divisions can be nested, and are further specified by their <att>type</att> and, possibly,
	  <att>subtype</att> attributes. For the recommended values of <att>type</att> we take as our model
	  the structure elements as defined by Akoma Ntoso. The <att>subtype</att> attribute is to
	  be used for cases where some facets of structures in the source data cannot be otherwise retained
	  in the Parla-CLARIN encoding, i.e. it is used when we do not want to lose some information about
	  the source data structures.</p>

        <head>Conversions</head>
	<p>A TEI encoded document is, in general, not meant to be used directly by software programs, rather
	it serves as an interchange and storage format.
	Furthermore, most TEI documents are not "born TEI", but rather converted into TEI from
	some source format.
	In this section we discuss some up- and down-conversion scripts that have already been developed
	for transforming source formats into Parla-CLARIN and from Parla-CLARIN into formats immediatelly
	usable by software.</p>
