        <head>Introduction</head>
	<p>Corpora of parliamentary proceedings are a quintessential
	resource for a wide range of research questions from a number
	of SSH disciplines, such as critical discourse analysis,
	history, as well as Sociolinguistics. Their most
	distinguishing characteristic is that they are transcriptions
	of spoken language produced in controlled and regulated
	circumstances. For this reason, they are rich in invaluable
	(sociodemographic) metadata as well as easily available under
	the Freedom of Information Acts set in place to enable
	informed participation by the public and to improve effective
	functioning of democratic systems, making the datasets even
	more valuable.</p>
	
	<p>Given these reasons and the fact that parliamentary
	proceedings are more and more often avaliable on-line, many
	researchers have already compiled corpora of parliamentary
	proceedings.  However, these corpora are encoded in a variety of
	different annotation schemes, limiting their interchange and
	re-use.</p>
	
	<p>In order to overcome this problem, the presented recommendation
	proposes a schema that can be used for encoding of corpora of
	parliamentary proceedings, primarily for the purposes of scholarly
	investigations, and that could serve as a storage and interchange format
	for such corpora. This recommendations attempts to 
	take into account the following aspects of corpora parliamentary proceedings:
	<list>
	  <item>Structure: legislative periods, sessions, topics, speeches</item>
	  <item>Metadata: mandates, titles, parliamentary bodies, location, date
	  and time</item>
	  <item>Speakers: age, party membership, links to external resources</item>
	  <item>Political parties: name(s), history</item>
	  <item>Speeches: speaker, text, comments, verbal and non-verbal interruptions</item>
	  <item>Text versions: verbatim or redacted records</item>
	  <item>Multimedia: audio and video, facsimile of original</item>
	  <item>Linguistic annotation: PoS tagging, normalisation, syntax</item>
	  <item>Legislative aspects: specification of laws, roll-calls</item>
	</list>
	</p>
	
	<p>The recommendation is implemented as a parametrisation of
	the TEI Guidelines, ...</p>
	
	<p>The rest of these guidelines are structured as follows...</p>
	
	<div xml:id="sec-scope">
          <head>Scope and purpose of the recommendation</head>
	  <p>This recommendation consists of guidelines and a formal TEI and XML
	  schema and is intended for the encoding of corpora of parliamentary
	  debates, regardless of the langauge or country of origin, for the
	  purposes of scholarly investigations, be they from the field of
	  linguistics, political science, history or other humanities and social
	  sciences disciplines. The recommendation is <emph>not</emph> meant as
	  the primary storage format of parliamentary debates, such as kept by
	  govermental offices, for which <ref target="sec-akoma">Akomo
	  Ntoso</ref> is preferred.</p>
	  
	  <p>
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>In developing a schema for structuring of data, two approaches can
	  be adopted, either a descriptive one, whereby as much as possible of
	  the original data distinctions are kept in the target encoding, and
	  the perscriptive one, where the target encoding is severly
	  constrained, to enable seamless data interchange and
	  esp. interoperability with software tools. The present recommendation
	  adopts the <emph>descriptive</emph> approach, as the source data, time
	  and effort devoted to converting it, the intended applications, as
	  well as country-specific rules of parliamentary debates will differ
	  considerably, and it is likely that any perscriptive schema would soon
	  turn out to be too restrictive. Nevertheless, the recommendation does
	  try to limit the plethora of encoding options otherwise available in
	  TEI to those that could be sensibly applied to corpora of
	  parliamentary debates, and where more than one option is available in
	  TEI to encode a given phenomenon, the descriptive guidelines or the
	  schema attempt to allow only one option.</p>

	    <p>The <ref target="https://www.clarin.eu/">CLARIN</ref>
	    European Research Infrastructure for Language Resources
	    and Technology has already organised a number of
	    initatives and events that deal with parliamentary
	    corpora:
	    <list>

  	    </list>
	    At these events it became clear that existing
	    parliamentary corpora are encoded in many different way,
	    presenting a barrier to their interchange. Therefore the
	    CLARIN Interoperability Committee organised a focused
	    <q><ref

	    ParlaFormat</ref></q> workshop (May 23-24, 2019,
	    Amersfoort) with selected participants at which the idea
	    of the present recommendation was introduced, the
	    participants presented their own experiences with encoding
	    parliamentary corpora and their comments to the draft
	    proposal, and the authors of the proposal gave responses
	    to these comments. The details are given in the <ref

        <head>General requirements</head>
	
	<div>
          <head>Characters</head>
	  
	  <p>A Parla-CLARIN corpus should, in general, capture as much
	  of the text and markup from the source as possble, while the
	  presence of graphical items or other elements that could not
	  or were not transcribed should be indicated by markup, in
	  particular with the use of <gi>gap</gi>.</p>
	  
	  <p>The corpus should be encoded in Unicode, using the UTF-8
	  character encoding, at least for European languages.  In cases
	  where the original contains characters from the Unicode
	  Private Use Area, these should be either given their closest
	  equivalents, or, preferably, be appropriatelly marked up by
	  the use of the <gi>g</gi> element.</p>
	  
	  <p>End-of-line hyphens can be removed, and the split words
	  joined in order to simplify linguistic processing.</p>
	  
	  <p>Two characters, esp. prevalent when the source documents
	  are in Word, deserve special mention:
	  
	  <list>
	    <item>Non-breaking pace (U+00A0), which prevents, with some
	    applications, collapsing consecutive white space characters
	    into a single space. As TEI-Parla is not interested in
	    preserving the details of the layout, it is recommended that
	    this character is substituted by the regular space
	    (U+0020).</item>
	    
	    <item>Soft hyphen (U+00AD), which indicates that a word can
	    be hyphenated at that point. These characters should be
	    removed from the corpus, as they only complicate further
	    processing.</item>
	  </list>
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>While not required, it is sensible to also normalise
	  sequences of whitespace characters (such as tabulators,
	  end-of-line characters and spaces) into a single space or
	  end-of-line character. Again, this simplifies further
	  (esp. linguistic) processing.</p>
	  
	</div>
	
	<div>
          <head>Documenting the encoding process</head>
	  
	  <p>Difficult encoding situations that are not covered by the
	  TEI Guidelines should be documented in the
	  <gi>editorialDecl</gi> of the corpus TEI header.
	  
	  In particular, if the source texts has been changed (so,
	  ommitting or normalising figures, text, EOL hyphens, special
	  characters, etc. as discussed above) this practice should be
	  documented in the <gi>correction</gi> and
	  <gi>normalization</gi> elements of the editorial
	  declaration.</p>
	  
	</div>
	
	<div>
          <head>Languages</head>
	  <p>The language of an element's text content is in TEI, as
	  in XML, signaled by the value of its <att>xml:lang</att>
	  attribute.  The Parla-CLARIN recommendation requires that the root
	  element of the corpus should have an <att>xml:lang</att>
	  attribute, and, furthermore, that each element that contains
	  text is either marked by this attribute, or one of its
	  ancestors is. Note that if, going by the ancestor axis, the
	  values of two <att>xml:lang</att> are in conflict, the one
	  closer to the context node is relevant one.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>The values of <att>xml:lang</att> should follow <ref
	  target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP 47</ref>,
	  cf. also <q><ref
	  target="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-when-xmllang">xml:lang
	  in XML document schemas</ref></q>.</p>
	  
	  <p>It is good practice to document the languages used in the
	  <gi>langUsage</gi> element of the TEI header.</p>
	  
	  <p>Apart from the above considerations, a related question
	  is where to draw the line between the object and meta
	  languages, i.e. the language of the corpus and the language
	  of the mark-up. The TEI defines the names of the elements
	  and attributes in English, and the language of the corpus
	  will, of course, depend on the country of the parliament. It
	  is less clear in which language the names of the attribute
	  values should be. Parla-CLARIN recommends that these should
	  also be in English.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
          <head>Identifiers and referencing</head>
	  <p>In order to simply refer to elements of a TEI document
	  (i.e. a Parla-CLARIN corpus), these are given an
	  <att>xml:id</att> attribute, as defined by <ref
	  target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-id/">W3C</ref>.</p>
	  
	  <p>Parla-CLARIN requires an <att>xml:id</att> attribute on
	  the root element of each corpus file, which should,
	  furthermore, be identical to the filename (modulo the file
	  extension).
	  Parla-CLARIN also recommends that the divisions
	  of the document (element <gi>div</gi>) should also be given
	  identifiers. While any element can be given an
	  <att>xml:id</att>, this is in general, not a good idea;
	  rather, only those elements that will be referenced should
	  be marked with this attribute.
	  </p>
	  <p>TEI offers a number of attributes that contain (URI)
	  pointers.  Where the reference is to an element inside the
	  document, the value of the <att>xml:id</att> being referred
	  to should be preceded by a hash (#), as mandated by the XML
	  standard. However, TEI also offers another way of pointing,
	  which can be used to shorten otherwise long URI references,
	  and this is defined by the <gi>listPrefixDef</gi> element in
	  the TEI header.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	  <head>Files</head>
	  <p>While this recommendation makes the assumption that a
	  complete corpus is one TEI XML document, this does not mean
	  that it should also be stored in one file, as the file
	  structure is distinct from the concept of XML documents. To
	  enable one XML document to be composed of several files, the
	  <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">XInclude</ref>
	  recommendation should be used.</p>
	  
	  <p>We recommend that the file has the same name as the value
	  of the <att>xml:id</att> attribute of the root element of the
	  file. This e.g. guarantees that each file of the corpus has a
	  unique name.</p>
	</div>
	
      </div>
      
      <div xml:id="sec-overall">
	<head>Overall document structure</head>
	
	<div>
          <head>Corpus structure</head>
	  
	  <p>As illustrated below, a CLARIN-Parla corpus should be
	  rooted in an <gi>teiCorpus</gi> element, which should also
	  contain the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute with the
	  appropriate language code<note>For multilingual documents
	  (excluding cases where only a minor part of the text is in
	  another language), this code would be <q>mul</q> for
	  <q>multiple languages</q></note>. The <gi>teiHeader</gi> of
	  the corpus then contains the metadata for the complete
	  corpus, including the metadata that is referred to by the
	  subordinate <gi>TEI</gi> elements, such as the defined
	  taxonomies and the list of speakers.</p>
	  
	  <p>We do not specify what an individual <gi>TEI</gi> element
	  should contain, as the size and granularity of parliamentary
	  debate corpora, not to mention the national rules of
	  structuring the workings of the parliament will differ
	  substantially. Typically, however, and individual
	  <gi>TEI</gi> element would contain one sitting or session or
	  one day, in any case such data that has common metadata that
	  distinguishes it from the other <gi>TEI</gi> elements in the
	  corpus.</p>
	  
	  <p>Finally, although not given in the Figure below, a
	  <gi>text</gi> element can contain, apart from the
	  <gi>body</gi> also a <gi>front</gi> element before it and/or
	  a <gi>back</gi> element after it. While the <gi>body</gi>
	  will contain the speeches and is obligatory, the former
	  could contain some preamble text, while the latter various
	  appendices or texts that are related to the speeches</p>

	  <p>In the text body, as well as in the front and back matter, the element that further

	  <p>The divisions can be nested, and are further specified by their <att>type</att> and, possibly,
	  <att>subtype</att> attributes. For the recommended values of <att>type</att> we take as our model
	  the structure elements as defined by Akoma Ntoso. The <att>subtype</att> attribute is to
	  be used for cases where some facets of structures in the source data cannot be otherwise retained
	  in the Parla-CLARIN encoding, i.e. it is used when we do not want to lose some information about
	  the source data structures.</p>

	<p>A TEI encoded document is, in general, not meant to be used directly by software programs, rather

	Furthermore, most TEI documents are not "born TEI", but rather converted into TEI from
	some source format.
	In this section we discuss some up- and down-conversion scripts that have already been developed
	for transforming source formats into Parla-CLARIN and from Parla-CLARIN into formats immediatelly
