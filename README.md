# Parla-CLARIN

This project aims to develop a TEI customisation for annotating
parliamentary debates.

The proposed format is centered on storing and interchanging
linguistically annotated corpora of parliamentary data to be used in
scholarly research.

Readable documentation can be found on
[gihub.io](https://clarin-eric.github.io/parla-clarin/), while the
[project Wiki](https://github.com/clarin-eric/parla-clarin/wiki) gives
instructions on how to validate your corpus against the Parla-CLARIN
schema and how to modify the schema for your own needs.

The project contains the following folders:

* [Schema](Schema/): The TEI ODD for the Parla-CLARIN annotation
  schema and derived XML schemas in in various formats (RelaxNG, W3C
  schema and DTD)
* [Examples](Examples/): Examples of parliamentary debates from
  various project that serve as examples of the Parla-CLARIN encoding
* [bin](bin/): Scripts for conversion and validation of the
  Parla-CLARIN TEI ODD schema and supporting documents
* [docs](docs/): Documentation in HTML, automatically derived from the
  Parla-CLARIN TEI ODD (and available from
  [gihub.io](https://clarin-eric.github.io/parla-clarin/))
